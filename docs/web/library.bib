abstract = {Fracture networks arise from the combination between fundamental fracturing processes and in situ conditions like geological factors, stress history, major faults, depth/pressure or rock mass properties. Changes of these conditions throughout space or time likely induce spatial variations of the fracture network geometrical properties. But the fracturing process itself induces consequent spatial variabil- ity which is not easily distinguished from the former. Thus, the complex spatial variability of fracture properties is a key issue for the DFN modeling. This project aims to review and upgrade the site DFN modeling approach initially introduced in Darcel et al. (2009), especially with regards to relations between models, model assessment from data and spatial variability of properties. In particular, we aim to identify this difference in the observed variability: intrinsic to the fracturing process or extrinsic, that is, constrained by in situ conditions changes. In this perspective the first stage of the work is dedicated to DFN models and modeling method- ology. The commonly named Poisson DFN models are considered and their spatial variability fully defined. These models are then used as reference cases when real data are considered. In the second stage real data from Forsmark site are analyzed to initially appraise their intrinsic density spatial variability and scaling behavior. This shows a typical signature of the real fracturing process which clearly differs from Poisson models and is closer to otherwise called fractal DFN models. Then the classification approach and the class properties assessment are applied to the Forsmark site and typical Statistical Fracture Models (SFM) are derived. The method is adapted to make objective analyses from any number of initial data. In the present case, close to 150 datasets with more than 60,000 data, are simultaneously considered into the classification process. The final classification identifies 5 to 6 major SFMs, whose definition strongly rely on the total density and to a depth dependence of the density of horizontal fractures. SKB},

abstract = {A study, started several years ago, aimed to construct a 3D hydro-mechanical model of the stimulation of the fracture network around each stimulated well at Soultz-sous-For{\^{e}}ts. In the framework of the European project on this "Scientific Pilot Plant", a numerical approach based on the distinct element method (3DEC code) is developed in order to understand and to explain the physical mechanisms which are at the origin of the hydraulic behavior observed during stimulation tests conducted in the various wells. The model is designed to reproduce the observed behavior in terms of pressure-flow curves as well as in terms of location of the stimulated fractures where the fluid is injected. The modeling approach has been first developed on the upper part of the reservoir where a maximum of data are available in the two wells constituting the geothermal doublet at a depth of around 3 500 m. Considering the satisfactory results of the first application, the hydro-mechanical model has been extended to the lower part of the reservoir at depth between 4 500 m and 5 000 m where the three deepest geothermal wells have been drilled. The various modeled cases show the role played by some main parameters on the results of the modeling such as orientation of the main permeable fractures, the intersection between them and their hydro-mechanical properties. The results obtained by the 3-dimensional models show that the permeability increase is highly associated with shearing on some fracture planes. These results also show a significant correlation between the orientations of the permeable fractures in relationship with the orientation of the in situ stresses. In conclusion, these models point out the importance of the knowledge of the geological structural and tectonic context of the site.},

abstract = {A comprehensive worldwide permeability data set has been compiled consisting of 29,000 in situ permeabilities from 221 publications and reports and delineating the permeability distribution in crystalline rocks into depths of 2000 meters below ground surface (mbgs). We analyze the influence of technical factors (measurement method, scale effects, preferential sampling, and hydraulic anisotropy) and geological factors (lithology, current stress regime, current seismotectonic activity, and long-term tectonogeological history) on the permeability distribution with depth, by using regression analysis and k-means clustering. The influence of preferential sampling and hydraulic anisotropy are negligible. A scale dependency is observed based on calculated rock test volumes equaling 0.6 orders of magnitude of permeability change per order of magnitude of rock volume tested. Based on the entire data set, permeability decreases as log(k) = −1.5 × log(z) − 16.3 with permeability k (m2) and positively increasing depth z (km), and depth is the main factor driving the permeability distribution. The permeability variance is about 2 orders of magnitude at all depths, presumably representing permeability variations around brittle fault zones. Permeability and specific yield/storage exhibit similar depth trends. While in the upper 200 mbgs fracture flow varies between confined and unconfined, we observe confined fracture and matrix flow below about 600 mbgs depth. The most important geological factors are current seismotectonic activity (determined by peak ground acceleration) and long-term tectonogeological history (determined by geological province). The impact of lithology is less important. Based on the regression coefficients derived for all the geological key factors, permeability ranges of crystalline rocks at site scale can be predicted. First tests with independent data sets are promising.},

abstract = {The aim of this report is to evaluate the risks for future earthquakes in the vicinity

of the proposed nuclear waste repository sites at Forsmark and Oskarshamn Time periods

of 100 and 1,000 years will be considered, which implies that the focus of this study

is on an evaluation of the current, general situation in the region Major events on

a longer time scale, such as an ice-age, will only be briefly considered Earthquakes

are products of ongoing deformations within the Earth and this report will, therefore,

concentrate on the current state of knowledge about deformations in the region As

earthquakes are our most important source of information about deformations at depth

in the crust, we will focus on the available seismic data using the Nordic earthquake

catalog maintained at the Institute of Seismology, Helsinki University, and the recent

data from the new Swedish National Seismic Network Direct measurements of surface

deformation using the Global Positioning System will also be utilized in the analysis

Sweden is a low seismicity area, with most earthquakes being observed in the south-west,

around Lake Vaenern, along the north-east coast and in Norrbotten South-eastern Sweden

is on the contrary relatively inactive Seismicity is also, generally, episodic in

time which together with the short period of instrumental observation, approximately

100 years, makes our knowledge about the activity far from complete Although very

large earthquakes (magnitude about 8) have occurred in Sweden, it is generally agreed

that these were connected to the late stages of deglaciation at the end of the previous

ice-age At the time scales considered in this report, inferences from current seismicity

is of more relevance This data suggests that we should expect at least one magnitude

5 earthquake in our region every century and one magnitude 6 earthquake every one

thousand years In order to illustrate the effects of static and dynamic deformation

from a magnitude 5 earthquake, we use the Kaliningrad magnitude 50 event of September

2004 as a modeling example The event occurred at 20 km depth but we vary the depth

in order to see how the effects vary At a reasonable depth of 12 km, as the 1976 Gulf

of Finland earthquake, the static displacements at the Earth's surface do not exceed

02 mm and we would expect 005 g of acceleration, on crystalline bedrock Earthquake

focal mechanisms reflect the state of stress which caused the earthquake From the

focal mechanisms we can therefore infer the stress state Analysis of Swedish earthquakes

show that in central and southern Sweden the crust below a few kilometers depth is

in a state of strike-slip faulting, with the maximum horizontal stress directed WNW-ESE

This is confirmed by measurements in the two deep boreholes in Siljan The stress state

reflects the plate tectonic deformation caused by the opening of the Atlantic, which

dominates the stress field in Sweden Stresses due to postglacial rebound are much

less significant today compared to the tectonic stresses Direct observations of large-scale

surface deformation has been carried out in Sweden since 199 in the BIFROST project,

using permanent, continuous GPS-receivers The project has produced high quality estimates

of deformation rates which correlate very well with those obtained from glacial rebound

modeling In the residuals between model and observations there are indications of

relative displacement between the stations If these are fault movements, they indicate,

although the relative displacements are less than 1 mm/year, deformation that is orders

of magnitude larger than that observed in the seismic data, ie aseismic deformation

Earthquake data from the 1980s have earlier been interpreted as indicating aseismic

movement of the order 1 mm/year/100 km in southern Sweden In order to determine whether

or not aseismic deformation is present at this scale, a dense network of permanent

GPS-stations would be required, preferably in an area of high seismicity We recommend

that such GPS-measurements are initiated, also in the regions considered for the nuclear

waste repositories},

abstract = {Abstract: A coupled thermos-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) numerical model is presented to predict the long-term change in permeability of the porous rocks that are composed purely of quartz. Especially, the chemo-mechanical process of the pressure dissolution is explicitly taken into account in the model. By simulating the burial of high-level radioactive wastes in the deep subsurface (i.e., by applying the simulated confining pressure and temperature conditions), the long-term evolution of the rock permeability was predicted using the model. The predictions obtained a significant influence of the pressure dissolution on the change in permeability with time. The predicted permeability of the rocks close to the wastes decreased by roughly one order of magnitude in 104 years when considering the pressure dissolution, while the permeability changed little during the same period when the pressure dissolution was not considered. The reduction should delay the transportation of the radioactive materials. Introduction It is important to address the coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical processes when projecting a long-term underground isolation of the high-level radioactive wastes. The rocks that work as natural barriers to the migration of radionuclides should be influenced by the coupled phenomena, including the transfer of heat from the wastes, the groundwater flow, the variation in induced stresses, and the geochemical reactions, such as mineral dissolution and precipitation [1], [2]. Therefore, in order to predict the long-term evolution of the hydraulic property, a numerical model that can account for the coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes is required. In this study, a coupled THMC numerical model that includes the important process of the pressure dissolution, as well as the free-face dissolution and precipitation, is presented [3]. Then, the long-term evolution of the permeability in porous rock was predicted under the expected stress and temperature conditions where high-level radioactive wastes are disposed. In particular, the influence of the pressure dissolution on the change in the rock permeability was examined intensively.},

abstract = {In the context of geotechnical and geological barriers, a thorough analysis of uncertainty and sensitivity is a crucial aspect of any physics-based performance assessment. While experimental data are scarce in actual waste repositories, large-scale experiments in underground research laboratories (URLs) provide such data that can be used to not only qualify THMC process models but also uncertainty assessment methodologies. In this paper, we adopt a Design of Experiments (DoE)-based history matching workflow – an approach popular in the oil and gas industry – and scrutinize its applicability for multiphysical analyses of nuclear waste disposal-related processes using synthetic experimental data. Based on an analytical solution of a coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) problem of a heat source embedded in a fluid-saturated porous medium mimicking a disposal cell in an argillaceous host formation, we discuss the adaptability of the workflow as a way to address parameter and model uncertainties for barrier integrity assessment. We thereby put particular focus on the relative importance of providing defined input parameter distributions for quantities generally afflicted with epistemic uncertainty and the constraints imposed by experimental (URL) or monitoring (repository) data. We found that once constraining data is available, the particular a priori distribution plays only a minor role for the outcome, such that we can conclude that the often unknown distributions can be substituted by uniform priors under such conditions. However, detailed knowledge of parameter distributions can increase the efficiency of the workflow significantly. We conclude that the presented workflow is particularly suitable for performing uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis for geotechnical applications where monitoring or other experimental data are available, as it allows us to deal with models of great complexity, epistemic uncertainty and it incorporates canonically to use of measured data in order to reduce uncertainty.},

abstract = {A fully coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical (THM) finite element model is presented for fractured geothermal reservoirs. Fractures are modelled as surface discontinuities within a three-dimensional matrix. Non-isothermal flow through the rock matrix and fractures are defined and coupled to a mechanical deformation model. A robust contact model is utilised to resolve the contact tractions between opposing fracture surfaces under THM loadings. A numerical model has been developed using the standard Galerkin method. Quadratic tetrahedral and triangular elements are used for spatial discretisation. The model has been validated against several analytical solutions, and applied to study the effects of the deformable fractures on the injection of cold water in fractured geothermal systems. Results show that the creation of flow channelling due to the thermal volumetric contraction of the rock matrix is very likely. The fluid exchanges heat with the rock matrix, which results in cooling down of the matrix, and subsequent volumetric deformation. The cooling down of the rock matrix around a fracture reduces the contact stress on the fracture surfaces, and increases the fracture aperture. Stress redistribution reduces the aperture, as the area with lower contact stress on the fracture expands. Stress redistribution reduces the likelihood of fracture propagation under pure opening mode, while the expansion of the area with lower contact stress may increase the likelihood of shear fracturing.},

abstract = {The mechanical behaviour of frozen ground and permafrost is changing under the increasing variation of environmental and anthropogenic boundary conditions. This phenomenon affects many civil structures and infrastructures built in Polar and Alpine areas. Mathematical formulations able to capture the mechanical behaviour of frozen ground and permafrost with adherence to reality and a limited employment of technical resources and time appear crucial for the engineering design and retrofit of these structures. To address this challenge, this study presents a relatively simple elasto-plastic constitutive model for capturing the non-linear mechanical behaviour of frozen silt. The model is based on associated flow rules. It employs an elliptical yield surface and a parabolic yield surface for describing the volumetric mechanisms that characterise the modelled material, together with a parabolic yield surface for describing the deviatoric mechanism. Comparisons with experimental triaxial test results available in the literature highlight the suitability of the model to capture the non-linear mechanical response of frozen silt subjected to both low and high confining pressures. This result, together with the doable implicit consideration in the model of the effects induced by environmental boundary conditions such as temperature on the mechanical behaviour of the material, makes this tool attractive for simplified yet thorough analyses of frozen ground and permafrost-related problems.},

The main results of the project are characterised by the developed repository concepts adapted to the geological conditions. The specific quantifications of the integrity criteria and their exemplary application with calculational proofs were used to demonstrate the integrity of the host rocks. The development of site-specific FEP (features, events, and processes) cataloges provided a complete system description for evaluation of the repository evolution. The developed work flow of the demonstration concept illustrated the complete sequence of the safety proof in a transparent way.

abstract = {The Northeast German Basin (NEDB) is a c.300 km long and 200 km wide subbasin of the Mid- European Basin in which more than 8000m of volcanic and sedimentary rocks were accumulated. Evolution of the basin can be subdivided into five distinct phases. It begun with deposition of thick volcanic sequences in the Upper Carboniferous / Permian. This initial stage was followed by the Permo-Triassic main phase of subsidence, the Rhaetian- Jurassic phase of basin differentiation , the Cretaceous phase of inversion and the final cratonic stabilisation in the Tertiary - Quaternary. Petrographic, microthermometric and stable isotope ($\delta$34S, $\delta$13C, $\delta$18O) investigations of drill cores show that the burial history of the basin is documented in diagenetic mineral assemblages and fluid inclusion contained therein. Authigenic and hydrothermal minerals represent the chemical composition, chemical and physical parameters as well as origin and pathways of migration of several fluid systems. Investigations are based on 250 samples from deeps wells and 29 samples from surface outcrops in the NEDB . 211 samples were investigated by petrographic and microthermometric methods, 150 mineral separates were used for stable isotope analyses. Emphasis of the investigations was put on secondary carbonates, quartz, anhydrite, barite, fluorite and feldspars.},

abstract = {The H2020-DEEPEGS project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the Enhanced/Engineered Geothermal System Technology (EGS) to produce electricity and/or heat. One of the main technological challenges is to optimise the well architecture and stimulation methods to get economically viable flow rate in deep hot reservoir initially little productive (Peter-borie et al., 2020). The main idea of this work is to provide an overview of the impact of different stimulation methods considered to enhance the productivity of the targeted reservoir of an EGS demonstrator. The targeted fault zone is located in the granitic basement of the Upper Rhine Graben (Eastern France), at around 4400m TVD (True Vertical Depth) where the temperature is estimated around 200°C. Based on the drilling data recorded and structural hypothesis hinging on a multiscale approach, a conceptual model of the faulted geothermal reservoir is established. Then, a hydrothermal model of the fault zone is built. The numerical model is developed using the ComPASS code that enables the implementation of 2D discrete fracture or fault network coupled with the surrounding 3D matrix (so-called hybrid-dimensional model). The current code is able to handle compositional multiphase Darcy flows, relying on a Coats type formulation, coupled to the conductive and convective transfers of energy (Lopez et al., 2018). The impact of the different technologies used to enhance the injectivity of the well such as stimulation methods (the hydraulic and thermal stimulations are considered) or such as a multi-drain well geometry are studied through the simulation of an injection test. The effect of soft hydraulic stimulation resulting from the hydromechanical simulations (Blaisonneau et al., 2020a) is implemented into the hydrothermal model through the modification of the fractured reservoir properties. In parallel based on the same hydrothermal model the impact of multi-drain well geometry is studied. For each stimulation method, the injectivity can be compared with the initial model and the relative efficiency of each stimulation method can be assessed. Based on the knowledge of temperature fields obtained for each case through the hydrothermal simulations and using the results provided by the thermomechanical models (Peter-Borie et al., 2019), the permeability variations (around the well and in the matrix surrounding the fractures) are implemented into the hydrothermal model in order to assess the impact of thermal stimulation. The main aim of this study is to assess the influence of different stimulation methods into a unique hydrothermal model in order to test different stimulation scenarios. The final goal of this work is to provide numerical tools in order to investigate the relative efficiency of stimulation methods in the context of EGS.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Theory and numerical implementation describing groundwater flow and the transport of heat and solute mass in fully saturated fractured rocks with elasto-plastic mechanical feedbacks are developed. In our formulation, fractures are considered as being of lower dimension than the hosting deformable porous rock and we consider their hydraulic and mechanical apertures as scaling parameters to ensure continuous exchange of fluid mass and energy within the fracture–solid matrix system. The coupled system of equations is implemented in a new simulator code that makes use of a Galerkin finite-element technique. The code builds on a flexible, object-oriented numerical framework (MOOSE, Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment) which provides an extensive scalable parallel and implicit coupling to solve for the multiphysics problem. The governing equations of groundwater flow, heat and mass transport, and rock deformation are solved in a weak sense (either by classical Newton–Raphson or by free Jacobian inexact Newton–Krylow schemes) on an underlying unstructured mesh. Nonlinear feedbacks among the active processes are enforced by considering evolving fluid and rock properties depending on the thermo-hydro-mechanical state of the system and the local structure, i.e. degree of connectivity, of the fracture system. A suite of applications is presented to illustrate the flexibility and capability of the new simulator to address problems of increasing complexity and occurring at different spatial (from centimetres to tens of kilometres) and temporal scales (from minutes to hundreds of years).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The foundations of today's models were laid decades ago, inspired by measurements from mountain glaciers, discovery of the modern ice streams and the study of landscapes evacuated by former ice sheets. Models have progressed from strict adherence to the principles of groundwater flow, to the incorporation of flow `elements' specific to the subglacial environment, to sophisticated two-dimensional representations of interacting distributed and channelized drainage. Although presently in a state of rapid development, subglacial drainage models, when coupled to models of ice flow, are now able to reproduce many of the canonical phenomena that characterize this coupled system. Model calibration remains generally out of reach, whereas widespread application of these models to large problems and real geometries awaits the next level of development.},

abstract = {Identifying and evaluating the factors that might impact on the long-term integrity of a deep Geological Disposal Facility (GDF) and its surrounding geological and surface environment is central to developing a safety case for underground disposal of radioactive waste. The geological environment should be relatively stable and its behaviour adequately predictable so that scientifically sound evaluations of the long-term radiological safety of a GDF can be made. In considering this, it is necessary to take into account natural processes that could affect a GDF or modify its geological environment up to 1 million years into the future. Key processes considered in this paper include those which result from plate tectonics, such as seismicity and volcanism, as well as climate-related processes, such as erosion, uplift and the effects of glaciation. Understanding the inherent variability of process rates, critical thresholds and likely potential influence of unpredictable perturbations represent significant challenges to predicting the natural environment. From a plate-tectonic perspective, a one million year time frame represents a very short segment of geological time and is largely below the current resolution of observation of past processes. Similarly, predicting climate system evolution on such time-scales, particularly beyond 200 ka AP is highly uncertain, relying on estimating the extremes within which climate and related processes may vary with reasonable confidence. The paper highlights some of the challenges facing a deep geological disposal program in the UK to review understanding of the natural changes that may affect siting and design of a GDF.},

abstract = {The EGS concept has the necessity to increase the local natural permeability of low permeability rock masses. Hydraulic stimulation is a widely used technique to increase the permeability. This technique was applied at various depths in the wells of the Soultz-sous-For{\^{e}}ts site since the beginning of the project. This has yielded an effective and irreversible increase in permeability, which is associated with microseismic events. The understanding of the mechanisms that lead to local increases in permeability is essential to the development of this technique. Based on all the hydraulic stimulation tests that have been performed in the wells, a 3D hydro-mechanical model is proposed. The fracturation model selected around each well contains large deterministic fault zones (hectometric size), since they likely connect the well to the reservoir and potentially react during the hydraulic stimulation tests. A 3D Distinct Element Method model was developed, with a specific hydro-mechanical coupling, where flow takes place only in the fractures and the rock matrix is impermeable and deformable. The constitutive law of the fault zones is a Mohr-Coulomb law for the mechanical part with an independent associated dilatancy law for the hydraulic part. Hydraulic stimulation tests and post- stimulation injection tests have been performed with this model. The results obtained clearly indicate how an irreversible increase in the permeability is caused by the shearing that occurs in the fault zones during the hydraulic stimulation tests. The location of this shearing in the fault zones results from the combination of the in-situ stresses, their orientations, and their interconnections. The magnitudes of the calculated shear displacements were found to be consistent with the observations along the wells and the information obtained from the analysis of the microseismic events.},

At time scales relevant for repository safety assessments (i.e., 1. Ma), future ice ages are an important external perturbation to repository integrity in mid-latitudes and northern latitudes. Ice ages result in the alteration of the landscape by glacial erosion and sedimentation; lead to the formation of periglacial permafrost; and impose significant transient hydraulic, mechanical, thermal, and chemical changes that can influence groundwater flow and radionuclide mobility. Four case studies are presented: (1) discussing the processes involved in the formation of deeply incised troughs and overdeepened valleys in the Swiss Plateau; (2) outlining the occurrence and dimensions of tunnel valleys in the North German Plain and their impact on repository host rocks; (3) illustrating the integration of techniques and geoscientific evidence, as applied in assessing the stability and resilience of a deep-seated groundwater system in the Great Lakes Basin of North America; and (4) detailing results of a numerical modeling study of the impact of periglacial and glacial climate conditions on groundwater flow in the Fennoscandian Shield. 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The sudden cooling is typically linked to an abrupt slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in response to meltwater discharges from ice sheets. However, inconsistencies regarding the YD-response of European summer temperatures have cast doubt whether the concept provides a sufficient explanation. Here we present results from a high-resolution global climate simulation together with a new July temperature compilation based on plant indicator species and show that European summers remain warm during the YD. Our climate simulation provides robust physical evidence that atmospheric blocking of cold westerly winds over Fennoscandia is a key mechanism counteracting the cooling impact of an AMOC-slowdown during summer. Despite the persistence of short warm summers, the YD is dominated by a shift to a continental climate with extreme winter to spring cooling and short growing seasons.},

abstract = {Significant pressure and temperature changes can occur within geothermal reservoirs caused by injection and production of fluid which can affect transport properties of the rocks and therefore alter reservoir performance and sustainability. To understand the coupling between transport properties evolution and state variable changes, a complete description of the mechanical behavior of the reservoir is required which should consider thermo- and poroelastic effects. This study aims to integrate transport properties evolution for coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) process modelling of fluid-bearing reservoirs. This approach is here applied to the geothermal research site of Gro{\ss} Sch{\"{o}}nebeck (40 km north of Berlin, Germany) which consists of a doublet system at a target depth of about − 4100 m in which both injection and production wells have been hydraulically stimulated. A 3D reservoir model including the main geological units, major natural fault zones and hydraulic fractures is integrated in the finite-element method-based simulator OpenGeoSys for modelling coupled THM processes during geothermal activity. One challenge of this study is to integrate both hydro-geological and physical complexity to better describe the dynamic behavior of the geothermal reservoir. From the results of the simulation, thermal breakthrough is observed after 18 years of injection and life time of the system has been evaluated as 50 years. Furthermore, a 5.5{\%} increase of porosity around the injection well is observed as well as an increase of the anisotropy ratio for permeability (kz/kxy) of about 2{\%}. These transport properties enhancements lead to a decrease of the thermal breakthrough time (around − 8{\%}) and life time of the system (− 14{\%}) compared to classic thermo-hydro simulations with constant transport properties. The results presented here provide therefore valuable insights for understanding porosity and permeability distributions and evolutions during injection and production of geothermal fluids and related impacts on reservoir performance.},

abstract = {This report presents results from a project devoted to describing the climatic extremes within which the climate in Fennoscandia may vary over a 100,000 year time span. Based on forcing conditions which have yielded extreme conditions during the last glacial-interglacial cycle, as well as possible future conditions following continued anthropogenic emissions, projections of climate conditions have been made with climate models. Three different periods have been studied; i) a stadial within Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) during the last glacial cycle, representing a cold period with a relatively small ice sheet covering parts of Fennoscandia, ii) the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), with an extensive ice sheet covering large parts of northern Europe and iii) a possible future period in a climate warmer than today. The future case is characterised by high greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and a complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet. The climate modelling involved the use of a global climate model (GCM) for producing boundary conditions that were used by a regional climate model (RCM). The regional model produced detailed information on climate variables like near-surface air temperature and precipitation over Europe. These climate variables were subsequently used to force a vegetation model that produced a vegetation cover over Europe, consistent with the simulated regional climate. In a final step, the new vegetation cover from the vegetation model was used in the regional climate model to produce the final regional climate. For the studied periods, data on relevant climate parameters have been extracted from the regional model for the Forsmark and Oskarshamn areas on the Swedish east coast and the Olkiluoto region on the west coast of Finland. Due to computational constraints, the modelling efforts include only one forcing scenario per time period. As there is a large degree of uncertainty in the choice of an appropriate forcing scenario, we perform some additional sensitivity studies, and also compare our scenarios to other existing model scenarios when possible. In addition to the modelling activities, an effort has been made to collect palaeoclimatic information by compiling various MIS 3 and LGM proxy data from different sources. An attempt to use part of this palaeoclimatic information to constrain the forcing conditions used in the climate models has been made. Other proxy data were used for model evaluation purposes. We have compared results from the global climate model with proxy records of sea-surface temperatures and with terrestrial records. The regional climate model results have been compared with existing terrestrial palaeoclimate records from Europe. The results show that the climate models produce climates for the three periods that are in broad agreement with proxy data and other climate model simulations. The resulting climates are also in qualitative agreement with the imposed extent of ice sheets and types of vegetation. In particular, we show that the results for the MIS 3 stadial are consistent with ice-free conditions in south-central Fennoscandia and that this climate is suitable for permafrost growth. The simulations show that there is a large range in possible climates for the Fennoscandian region in a 100,000 year time perspective. Excluding the glacial situation, annual mean temperatures for the Forsmark, Oskarshamn and Olkiluoto sites differ from MIS 3 to the future warm climate by 12–15°C. Correspondingly, annual mean precipitation is almost a factor two higher in the future warm climate compared to MIS 3 at these sites. This report documents forcing conditions and model results, both from the global and regional climate models as well as from the vegetation model. Results from the project in the form of modelled climate and vegetation data for different climatic extremes are available for further impact studies in other projects. In addition to this report, other publications have also resulted from the project, summarised in Appendix A.},

abstract = {Energy and resources including coal, oil, and gas are in demand all over the world. Because these resources near the earth's surface have been exploited for many years, the extraction depth has increased. As mining shafts in the coal extraction process become deeper, especially in western China, an artificial freezing method is used and is concentrated in the fractured rock mass. The frost-heaving pressure (FHP) is directly related to the degree of damage of the fractured rock mass. This paper is focused on FHP during the freezing process, with emphasis on the frost-heaving phenomenon in engineering materials. A review of the frost phenomenon in the geotechnical engineering literature indicates that: (1) During the soil freezing process, the ice content that is influenced by unfrozen water and the freezing rate are the determining factors of FHP; (2) During the freezing process of rock and other porous media, the resulting cracks should be considered because the FHP may damage the crack structure; (3) The FHP in a joint rock mass is analyzed by the joint deformation in field and experimental tests and can be simulated by the equivalent expansion method including water migration and joint deformation.},

abstract = {The evolution of the landscape and the behavior of the groundwater system are key concerns for the long-term management of radioactive waste in deep geological repositories. At time scales relevant for repository safety assessments (i.e., 1. Ma), future ice ages are an important external perturbation to repository integrity in mid-latitudes and northern latitudes. Ice ages result in the alteration of the landscape by glacial erosion and sedimentation; lead to the formation of periglacial permafrost; and impose significant transient hydraulic, mechanical, thermal, and chemical changes that can influence groundwater flow and radionuclide mobility. Four case studies are presented: (1) discussing the processes involved in the formation of deeply incised troughs and overdeepened valleys in the Swiss Plateau; (2) outlining the occurrence and dimensions of tunnel valleys in the North German Plain and their impact on repository host rocks; (3) illustrating the integration of techniques and geoscientific evidence, as applied in assessing the stability and resilience of a deep-seated groundwater system in the Great Lakes Basin of North America; and (4) detailing results of a numerical modeling study of the impact of periglacial and glacial climate conditions on groundwater flow in the Fennoscandian Shield. 2015 Elsevier Inc.

DES is a finite-element solver for the dynamic and quasi-static simulation of continuous media. The experiments within demonstrate the potential for DES to simulate ice failure and deformation in dynamic regions of glaciers, especially at quickly changing boundaries like glacier termini in contact with the ocean. We explore the effect that different rheological assumptions have on the pattern of flow and failure. We find that the use of a semi-brittle constitutive law is a sufficient material condition to form the characteristic pattern of basal crevasse-aided pinch-and-swell geometry, which is observed globally in floating portions of ice and can often aid in eroding the ice sheet margins in direct contact with oceans.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art climate models were used to simulate climate conditions in Europe during Greenland Stadial (GS) 12 at 44 ka BP. The models employed for these simulations were: (i) a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean global climate model (AOGCM), and (ii) a regional atmospheric climate model (RCM) to dynamically downscale results from the global model for a more detailed investigation of European climate conditions. The vegetation was simulated off-line by a dynamic vegetation model forced by the climate from the RCM. The resulting vegetation was then compared with the a priori vegetation used in the first simulation. In a subsequent step, the RCM was rerun to yield a new climate more consistent with the simulated vegetation. Forcing conditions included orbital forcing, land-sea distribution, ice-sheet configuration, and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations representative for 44 ka BP. The results show a cold climate on the global scale, with global annual mean surface temperatures 5 °C colder than the modern climate. This is still significantly warmer than temperatures derived from the same model system for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Regional, northern European climate is much colder than today, but still significantly warmer than during the LGM. Comparisons between the simulated climate and proxy-based sea-surface temperature reconstructions show that the results are in broad agreement, albeit with a possible cold bias in parts of the North Atlantic in summer. Given a prescribed restricted Marine Isotope Stage 3 ice-sheet configuration, with large ice-free regions in Sweden and Finland, the AOGCM and RCM model simulations produce a cold and dry climate in line with the restricted ice-sheet configuration during GS 12. The simulated temperature climate, with prescribed ice-free conditions in south-central Fennoscandia, is favourable for the development of permafrost, but does not allow local ice-sheet formation as all snow melts during summer. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {The Prototype Repository (PR) was a field test of six, electrically heated, full-scale waste containers resembling the key component of a KBS-3 nuclear waste repository. The design and heat load was similar to the proposed repository at Forsmark, Sweden. In this paper, the thermal, mechanical and thermo-mechanical response of the PR host rock to excavation and to the subsequent heating is assessed. The assessment is carried out using three-dimensional models (numerical and analytical) in combination with monitoring data and visual observations from the excavations. Certain measurements and observations agree well with results from the models. These include temperature measurements during the heating phase. Additional measurements include patterns of lowmagnitude acoustic emission events around the deposition holes tracked during the excavation. The spatial distribution of these events coincide with regions of modelled high compressive stresses. Models with a simple fracture network, consisting of planar disks with laboratory-scale properties, appear to give upper bound estimates of the stress disturbances caused by a real fracture network. The magnitude of the modelled stresses around the deposition hole is typically below the spalling strength. The lack of any significant or systematic occurrence of spalling in the deposition hole walls supports the modelling results. Several instruments installed at different positions to monitor stress change, strain and deformation malfunctioned during the nearly 8-year-long monitoring period. Despite this, there is ample evidence to support the overall conclusion that the modelling results and observations are in sufficient agreement to strengthen the confidence in the modelling approach.},

@article{Perkins1961,
abstract = {Abstract A study of fluid mechanics, rupture of brittle materials and the theory of elastic deformation of rocks shows that, for a given formation, crack width is essentially controlled by fluid pressure drop in the fracture. Operating conditions which cause high pressure drop along the crack (such as high injection rate and viscous fluids) will result in relatively wide cracks. Conversely, operating conditions which cause low pressure drop (low injection rates and thin fluids) will result in relatively narrow cracks. Charts and equations have been derived which permit the estimation of fracture widths for a variety of flow conditions and for both horizontal and vertical fractures. Introduction There has been considerable speculation concerning the geometry of hydraulically created fractures in the earth's crust. One of the questions of practical importance is the width of fractures under dynamic conditions, i.e., while the fracture is being created and extended. Such width information could be used, for instance, to help estimate the area of a fracture generated under various conditions. Also, there has been a recent trend toward the use of large propping particles. Therefore is desirable to know what factors can be varied in order to assure entry of the large particles into the fracture. There has been some work on fracture widths reported in the literature. In particular, there have been several Russian publications dealing with this subject. These papers have dealt principally with the elastic theory and the application of this theory to hydraulic fractures. These studies have not led to an engineering method for estimating fracture widths under dynamic conditions. A recent papers has reviewed and summarized the Russian concepts. An earlier paper from our laboratories also discussed the application of the elastic theory to hydraulic fractures. This first approach, based largely on photoelastic studies, has proved to be too simplified to accurately describe the fracturing process. However, these early thoughts have served as a guide during the development of more exact concepts. We would like to present in this paper our current concepts regarding fracture widths and some estimates of hydraulic fracture widths for several conditions. We believe that it is now possible to predict with fair accuracy the factors influencing fracture widths. Furthermore, the method of prediction has been reduced to a simple and convenient graphical or numerical calculation. CRACKS IN A BRITTLE, ELASTIC MATERIAL Many investigators have shown that competent rocks behave elastically over some range of stresses. Of course, if the tensile stress imposed upon a rock exceeds some limiting value, then the rock will fail in tension. In similar manner, there are some limiting shear stresses that can be imposed upon rocks. Hubbert and Willis have discussed the shear conditions which will lead to failure. Under moderate stress conditions (such as those likely to be encountered when hydraulically fracturing) and when stresses are rapidly applied, relatively, most rocks will fail in a brittle manner. Hence, for this discussion of hydraulic fractures in the earth's crust, we assume the rocks behave as brittle, elastic materials. Let us develop the discussion in the following way. (The following thoughts are applicable only to brittle materials.) 1. First we consider a brittle, elastic system. An energy balance will show the minimum pressure necessary to fracture rock, and from this pressure we calculate the minimum crack width resulting from extension of a hydraulic fracture. 2. Then we will show that, under ordinary fracturing conditions, fracture widths are appreciably greater than the minimum widths of extending fractures. In fact, we will find that crack width is controlled by fluid pressure drop in the fracture. 3. We will discuss pressure drops in fractures and resulting crack widths for various operating conditions and both vertical and horizontal fractures. 4. Finally, we ill discuss the significance of these concepts, their relationship to fracturing pressures. etc. First, consider minimum fracture extension pressures. We can shed some light on this question by considering the theory proposed by Griffith to explain the rupture of brittle, elastic materials. Griffith recognized that solid materials exhibit a surface energy (similar to surface tension in a liquid). JPT P. 937},

The major portion of the material comes from the reports of the three phases of the project and many progress reports submitted by the research teams over the three year period. The majority of the scientific issues and lessons learned have been discussed in length at a number of project workshops and will remain to be the subject of future research in rock mechanics and coupled T-H-M processes for nuclear waste disposal. The project will continue for three more years (1995 - 1998), as DECOVALEX II.

Standing at the transition point between the DECOVALEX I and DECOVALEX II, the editors, together with the Steering Committee of DECOVALEX I, feel both encouraged about the progresses we have made and anxious about what still lay ahead. The DECOVALEX project has been recognized by a much larger international community as one of the very successful co-operative research projects for deepening our understanding of coupled T-H-M processes for radioactive waste isolations. The key factor for our success is the genuine co-operative spirit of the hard working researchers and national nuclear waste management agencies from all participating countries.

Die Arbeiten f{\"{u}}r eine solche Art der Endlagerung stehen in Deutschland noch am Anfang. Gegenw{\"{a}}rtig existiert noch kein entsprechendes Sicherheitskonzept, dass es erlaubt, f{\"{u}}r die Nachverschlussphase eines Endlagers aus Zielsetzungen der Langzeitsicherheit planerische Festlegungen und schlie{\ss}lich technische Ma{\ss}nahmen abzuleiten. Die Entwicklung eines Endlagerkonzepts ist ein iterativer Prozess zwischen Endlagerkonzeptentwicklung und Sicherheitskonzeptentwicklung. Das hier vorgestellte Vorhaben ist Teil dieses Prozesses und geh{\"{o}}rt zum Bereich der Endlagerkonzeptentwicklung. Im Rahmen dieses Vorhabens werden drei unterschiedliche Konzepte zur Herstellung der langzeitsicheren Einschlusswirksamkeit eines Endlagersystems im Kristallingestein verfolgt. Diese drei Konzepte wurden im FuE Vorhaben CHRISTA /Jobmann 2016a/ als diejenigen identifiziert, die in Bezug auf das realistische Vorkommen der zugrunde gelegten geologischen Formationen in Deutschland und der Nachweisbarkeit der Langzeitsicherheit als erfolgversprechend gelten k{\"{o}}nnen. Dabei ist die Ausweisung eines einschlusswirksamen Gebirgsbereichs nach Standortauswahlgesetzt /StandAG 2017/ nicht zwingend. Ein Endlagerkonzept darf sich auch in der Hauptsache auf technische oder geotechnische Barrieren st{\"{u}}tzen. Die drei Konzepte sind:  Das KBS-3 Konzept, das in Schweden und Finnland zur Endlagerung verfolgt wird und sich im Nachweis wesentlich auf korrosionsbest{\"{a}}ndige Kupferbeh{\"{a}}lter und Bentonitbuffer in vertikalen Bohrl{\"{o}}chern st{\"{u}}tzt.  Das Konzept vom „Multiplen ewG“, welches darauf beruht, dass sich in einer Kristallinformation statt eines einzelnen zusammenh{\"{a}}ngenden ewG (einschlusswirksamer Gebirgsbereich), der alle Abf{\"{a}}lle aufnehmen kann, nur mehrere, voneinander r{\"{a}}umlich getrennte Gebirgsk{\"{o}}rper als ewG ausweisen und deren Einschlussverm{\"{o}}gen nachweisen lassen.  Das Konzept eines „{\"{u}}berlagernden ewG“, in dem eine sediment{\"{a}}re {\"{U}}berdeckung des kristallinen Wirtsgesteins (z. B. aus Ton oder Salz) nachweislich die Einschlusswirksamkeit herstellt. Zu jedem dieser Konzepte wird in diesem Vorhaben ein eigenes Endlagerkonzept entwickelt. F{\"{u}}r deren Erarbeitung ist es notwendig, Grundlagen zusammenzustellen. Dazu geh{\"{o}}rt zun{\"{a}}chst das Wissen {\"{u}}ber Kristallingesteine und kristalline Gebirgsformationen in Deutschland, die als Wirtsgestein f{\"{u}}r ein Endlager in Frage kommen k{\"{o}}nnten. Da dieses Vorhaben einen generischen Charakter besitzt, wurde keine regionale Eingrenzung oder gar eine Standortauswahl vorgenommen. Gerade in Bezug auf die Geologie bestehen au{\ss}erdem gro{\ss}e Unsicherheiten und Wissensl{\"{u}}cken. Diese ziehen sich entlang vieler Fragen durch das gesamte Vorhaben und werden deswegen regelm{\"{a}}{\ss}ig thematisiert. Weiterhin geh{\"{o}}ren zu den Grundlagen die verbindlichen Anforderungen, die, soweit nach heutigem Stand bekannt, an ein Endlagerkonzept gestellt werden m{\"{u}}ssen, sowie die Art und Menge der zu endlagernden Abf{\"{a}}lle. Auf dieser Basis werden die drei Konzepte aus /Jobmann 2016a/ weiterentwickelt. Das schon existierende KBS-3-Konzept muss dabei entsprechend der in Deutschland geltenden Anforderungen angepasst werden und wird damit zum modifizierten KBS-3 Konzept. Die Planung eines passenden Einlagerungskonzepts ist das Kernst{\"{u}}ck jedes Endlagerkonzepts. Es m{\"{u}}ssen aber auch weitere technische Fragestellungen untersucht werden. Dazu geh{\"{o}}rt die Gestaltung der Endlagerbeh{\"{a}}lter, die, je nach Konzept, deutlich anderen Anforderungen gen{\"{u}}gen m{\"{u}}ssen als in den Wirtsgesteinen Salz und Ton. Ebenso muss gekl{\"{a}}rt werden, mit welchen technischen Mitteln die Abfallgebinde transportiert werden k{\"{o}}nnen. Dabei kann auf einen umfangreichen Stand von Wissenschaft und Technik zur{\"{u}}ckgegriffen werden. Bergbauliche Fragestellungen, vor allem der Vortriebstechnik und der Standfestigkeit der Grubenbaue, sind f{\"{u}}r die Machbarkeit eines Endlagers ein weiteres wesentliches Thema, das in diesem Vorhaben bearbeitet wird. F{\"{u}}r die Langzeitsicherheit ist das vorgeschlagene Verf{\"{u}}ll- und Verschlusskonzept essentiell. All diese Arbeiten f{\"{u}}hren schlie{\ss}lich zur Erarbeitung exemplarischer Grubengeb{\"{a}}ude f{\"{u}}r die drei verschiedenen Konzepte (modifiziertes KBS-3-Konzept, multipler ewG, {\"{u}}berlagernder ewG). Der Bericht schlie{\ss}t mit einer Darstellung der Zeit- und Kostensch{\"{a}}tzungen f{\"{u}}r die Realisierung von Endlagern entsprechend dieser drei Konzepte und einer Zusammenfassung der Ergebnisse des Vorhabens.},

abstract = {This report contains the results of the research and development activities performed between 01.08.2003 and 30.06.2008 in the framework of the research project: “ Investigation on the Thermal, Hydraulic and Mechanic (THM) Behavior of the Bentonite Barrier by Measurements and Numerical Calculations” - MUSTER This work focused on the Temperature Buffer Test (TBT). The experiment is a heating test operated by ANDRA and SKB with the scale 1:1 consisting of two canisters installed in a short vertical borehole in granite in the {\"{A}}SP{\"{O}} Hard Rock Laboratory Sweden. The canister below is covered by bentonite, the upper one with sand layer and with bentonite respectively. The ongoing THM processes were extensively monitored with sensors for measurements of temperature, capillary pressure, total pressure, pore water pressure and relative humidity. For evaluation purposes a few fiber optic sensors have been installed by DBE Technology in two measurement levels since they have never been tested under such a strong thermal load ({\textgreater}150°C). Three-quarter of the sensors failed in the period of 5 years. Being installed in a strong temperature gradient, the temperature compensation of the pressure signal caused significant problems and some doubts in the absolute accuracy are still remaining. Results of laboratory tests on the bentonite used as a buffer are presented. Thermo-physical properties of MX-80 bentonite samples such as thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, thermal diffusivity and thermal expansion have been analyzed and applied for further modeling work. The empirical formulations indicate that the water content and temperature development has strong influence on these properties especially on thermal expansion (shrinkage). The code TOUGH2 (Transport of Unsaturated Groundwater and Heat) was applied to calculate the TH (thermo-hydraulic) coupled two-phase flow in bentonite whereas a good fit of calculated and measured temperature and suction values has been achieved and for hydraulic and thermal calculations plausible parameter sets have been obtained so far. The TH coupled calculations were performed by means of simplified axisymmetric 2D (quasi 3D) model. Suction controlled saturation process is simulated by using van Genuchten`s formula and thermal conductivity is determined as a function of temperature and water content. Good fits between measured and computed temperature values around both heaters have been obtained. Subsequent to thermal calculations, the thermal-only calibrated model was selected as an initial model for hydraulic analyses and approximately two hundred and thirty simulations were performed. In the framework of sensitivity analyses, the hydraulic parameters related to capillary pressure were used in order to calibrate the results of simulations with the in-situ data. Finally, for suction the most sensitive parameters were obtained, these are; saturation of the liquid phase SL, Van Genuchten`s notation m and intrinsic permeability along the x direction kx in turn. For different distances to the heaters, suitable fittings of the simulated and the observed capillary pressure values were obtained by using designated statistical methods. Finally, it can be concluded that participating in the modeling work of the TBT yields a significant increase of understanding the processes of water and heat flow in compacted bentonite.},

abstract = {The present report addresses aspects of the Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical (THM) evolution of the repository host rock that are of potential importance to the SR-Site safety assessment of a KBS-3 type spent nuclear fuel repository The report covers the evolution of rock temperatures, rock stresses, pore pressures and fracture transmissivities during the excavation and operational phase, the temperate phase and a glacial cycle on different scales The glacial cycle is assumed to include a period of pre-glacial permafrost with lowered temperatures and with increased pore pressures in the rock beneath the impermeable permafrost layer The report also addresses the question of the peak temperature reached during the early temperate phase in the bentonite buffer surrounding the spent fuel canisters The main text is devoted exclusively to the projected THM evolution of the rock at the Forsmark site in central Sweden The focus is on the potential for stress-induced failures, ie spalling, in the walls of the deposition holes and on changes in the transmissivity of fractures and deformation zones All analyses are conducted by a combination of numerical tools (3DEC) and analytical solutions All phases are treated separately and independently of each other, although in reality construction will overlap with heat generation because of the step-by-step excavation/deposition approach with some 50 years between deposition of the first and last canisters It is demonstrated here that the thermal and thermo-mechanical evolution of the near-field will be independent of heat generated by canisters that were deposited in the past, provided that deposition is made in an orderly fashion, deposition area by deposition area Peak temperatures and near-field stresses can, consequently, be calculated as if all canisters were deposited simultaneously The canister and tunnel spacing is specified such that the peak buffer temperature will not exceed 100 deg C in any deposition hole, ie not even in the hottest ones To account for uncertainties in the thermal calculations, the layout is established with a margin of about 5 deg C to the 100 deg C limit It is demonstrated here that the spatial variability of rock heat transport properties means that there is considerable robustness in the design approach An underestimate of the uncertainty margin by a few degrees appears to impact on very few canisters, even under the conservative assumption that all deposition holes are completely dry Spalling after excavation of a deposition hole excavation is not likely unless the major horizontal stress is aligned off the orientation of the tunnel axis by the largest angle given within the uncertainty range of the Forsmark in situ stress model In case it happens, the spalling will be limited to the top 1 m of the deposition hole for the most likely Forsmark major stress magnitude and to the top 3 m for the upper bound stress magnitude Thermally-induced spalling is almost certain to occur after some time of heating, ie also for the most favourable conditions regarding stress orientation and magnitude However, for the most favourable conditions the spalling will occur late and be limited to the top 5 m of the deposition hole All spalling risk estimates are based on the assumption that the spalling strength varies between 52{\%} and 62{\%} of the uniaxial compressive strength of the intact rock, as suggested by field experiments performed in the Aespoe Hard Rock Laboratory It is also assumed that the deposition holes are completely dry, ie without any swelling pressure to support and stabilize the walls These assumptions are all claimed to be conservative The stress path for rock in the walls of KBS-3 deposition holes will be different from corresponding stress paths in the field experiments and a small support pressure, possibly sufficient to limit the extent of the spalling, will be found also in dry deposition holes Transmissivity effects on rock fractures are evaluated on different scales by use of stress-transmissivity models based on results fro m lab scale tests on rock joint samples from Forsmark At distances of 1-2 metres from the repository openings, the proximity to the openings and the fracture geometry, eg the angle and location of fracture-opening intersections, are more important to the impacts on transmissivity than details in the description of the background stress evolution Therefore, the results obtained for the region surrounding the openings in the SR-Can assessment are judged to be valid At larger distances, the stress evolution and the pore pressure evolution during the thermal phase and following glacial cycles control how transmissivities change During the thermal phase the compression increases for most fractures, giving unchanged or just slightly reduced transmissivities The largest relative systematic increase in transmissivity are found for horizontal fractures in non-heated regions between the deposition areas or just outside the repository and for vertical fractures close to the ground surface The increases are modest though, about a factor of two at maximum The largest transmissivity effects during the glacial cycle, a factor of about seven, are found for vertical fractures during a period of preglacial permafrost with increased pore pressure coinciding with a forebulge type stress field This increase is found just below the frozen ground and requires that the permafrost layer is impermeable and that lowered temperatures reduce the horizontal stresses At repository depth the increase is a factor of three at maximum},

abstract = {We consider possible approaches to the long-term prediction for seismic hazard in relation to the practical need for the safety of geological disposal of long-lived radioactive waste. The required period of prediction significantly exceeds the one reflected in the set of maps of General Seismic Zoning of the territory of the Russian Federation (GSZ-97). The first geological repository in Russia is planned to be set up in the Nizhnii Kan granite massif in the Krasnoyarsk Krai. This region is an intraplate territory with a relatively high seismic activity. We summarize the analysis of the known empirical generalizations and theoretical principles underlying the seismic hazard prediction. Real seismic events constantly violate forward-looking statements even for relatively short periods of time. These and other arguments suggest that the hypothesis of stationarity of the seismic regime, which is the basis of long-term prediction today, has limited and uncertain applicability in time. Intraplate earthquake prediction is especially uncertain because of the uncertainty in the factor responsible for generating tectonic stresses in these regions. The short horizon of the prediction, based on statistical methods, can be attributed to the nonlinearity of seismic geodynamic processes. Fundamental laws of tectonic processes should be used as the scientific basis for long-term predictions for seismic hazard at the sites chosen for geological disposal of long-lived radioactive waste. These processes can be reflected in models for the migration of the seismically active boundaries of lithospheric plates and the occurrence of seismic activity in intraplate regions.},

abstract = {Most currently permafrost-covered landscapes underwent fundamental shifts in the hydrogeological and the thermal regime as a result of deglaciation after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The transient effects of heat and fluid flow associated with retreating ice sheets are important to consider for the present-day hydrogeology of these regions. In this paper, we use numerical models to evaluate the evolution of taliks underneath proglacial lakes during deglaciation. In our models, the hydrological and thermal boundary conditions at the lake site are constraint by the hydrogeological impacts of ice sheet dynamics since the LGM. During the LGM, the ground surface was insulated from air temperatures, and as a result, there was no permafrost underneath the wet-based ice. Subsequently, ice sheet retreat led to an exposure of a proglacial area to subzero air temperatures and the formation of permafrost. Where proglacial lakes form, discharge of deeper groundwater becomes focused. In this scenario, subpermafrost groundwater flow is driven by a combination of direct subglacial recharge and elevated hydraulic heads preserved in that part of the aquifer. Advective heat flow can delay or prevent through taliks from freezing as function of aquifer properties. The presence and evolution of through taliks in thick permafrost can create complex and transient hydrogeological phenomena.},

Die Entsorgung der dabei anfallenden radioaktiven Abf{\"{a}}lle ist neben dem sicheren Betrieb der Kraftwerke eine wichtige Voraussetzung f{\"{u}}r die Nutzung der Kernenergie. Nach dem "Gesetz {\"{u}}ber die friedliche Verwendung der Kernenergie und den Schutz gegen ihre Gefahren" (Atomgesetz) ist der Bund zust{\"{a}}ndig f{\"{u}}r die sichere Endlagerung radioaktiver Abf{\"{a}}lle. Das Entsorgungskonzept des Bundes sieht vor, alle Arten radioaktiver Abf{\"{a}}lle in tiefen geologischen Formationen endzulagern. Dabei sind f{\"{u}}r die verschiedenen Kategorien des radioaktiven Abfalls auch unterschiedliche Endlagerwirtgesteine vorgesehen. Die Schachtanlage Konrad soll als Endlager f{\"{u}}r radioaktive Abf{\"{a}}lle mit vernachl{\"{a}}ssigbarer W{\"{a}}rmeentwickiung dienen. Unter dieser Kategorie von Abf{\"{a}}llen sind solche zu verstehen, die das umgebende Gestein um nicht mehr als 3 ° C erw{\"{a}}rmen und die dadurch an ein Endlager bez{\"{u}}glich der Beurteilung der thermischen und thermomechanischen Auswirkungen keine besonderen Anforderungen stellen. Die Entscheidung {\"{u}}ber die Inbetriebnahme des ehemaligen Eisenerzbergwerks Konrad als Endlager wird voraussichtlich Mitte der neunziger Jahre fallen. Es wird etwa 95{\%} der Menge aller radioaktiven Abf{\"{a}}lle aufnehmen k{\"{o}}nnen. F{\"{u}}r hochradioaktive Abf{\"{a}}lle sieht die Bundesregierung ebenfalls eine Endlagerung in tiefen geologischen Formationen vor. Der zu dieser Kategorie geh{\"{o}}rende Abfall soll am Standort Gorleben im Salzgestein endgelagert werden. Die untert{\"{a}}gige Erkundung im Salzstock Gorleben begann 1986 mit dem Abteufen der Sch{\"{a}}chte. Nach deren Fertigstellung sollen die f{\"{u}}r die weiteren Erkundungsarbeiten notwendigen Grubenr{\"{a}}ume aufgefahren werden und die nachfolgenden Untersuchungen sollen kl{\"{a}}ren, ob radioaktive Abf{\"{a}}lle sicher endgelagert werden k{\"{o}}nnen. Nach dem gegenw{\"{a}}rtigen Zeitplan kann das geplante Endlager Gorleben nach positivem Planfeststellungsbeschlu{\ss} den Betrieb nicht vor 2008 aufnehmen.Das Endlager f{\"{u}}r radioaktive Abf{\"{a}}lle Morsleben (KRAM) in einer Salzstruktur in Sachsen-Anhalt wird auf der Grundlage der am 22. April 1986 erteilten Dauerbetriebsgenehmigung betrieben. Diese gilt aufgrund des Einigungsvertrages und nach einem Urteil des Bundesverwaltungsgerichts vom 25. Juni 1992 bis zum 30. Juni 2000 fort. Es werden schwach- und mittelaktive Abf{\"{a}}lle mit geringen Konzentrationen an Alphastrahlern endgelagert. Unbeschadet der Fortf{\"{u}}hrung des Genehmigungsverfahrens Gorleben ist 1990 in der Koalitionsvereinbarung zur 12. Legislaturperiode zwischen CDU/CSU und F.D.P. eine Erkundung m{\"{o}}glicher weiterer Standorte f{\"{u}}r hochaktive, stark w{\"{a}}rmeentwickelnde Abf{\"{a}}lle vorgesehen.

Mit Schreiben des Bundesministers f{\"{u}}r Forschung und Technologie vom 31.05.1991 (Az. 316-5555-67-7/91) wurde die BGR beauftragt, zun{\"{a}}chst in den neuen Bundesl{\"{a}}ndern die Kenntnisse {\"{u}}ber in Frage kommende Standorte f{\"{u}}r die Endlagerung w{\"{a}}rmeentwickelnder hochradioaktiver Abf{\"{a}}lle auf einen Stand zu bringen, wie er in den alten Bundesl{\"{a}}ndern besteht.

abstract = {An outstanding legacy data set has been compiled from underground excavations mostly prospected and mined by the former Soviet (German) Stock Company Wismut describing the hydrology of faulted basement rocks in the Ore Mountains (SE Germany). It consists of more than 5000 detailed descriptions of groundwater inflows to about 660 km of tunnels and 57 km of drillings measured during or shortly after excavation. Inflow measurements (recorded between 1E−8 and 4E−2 m3/s) have been converted to fracture transmissivities using a simplified analytical solution. Discarding site specific effects, the median log transmissivity decreases from 1E−7 to 1E−10 m2/s within the studied depth interval of 0–2000 meters below ground surface (mbgs), and the spacing of conductive fracture increases from 0.1 to 2500 m. This general trend is overprinted at three mining sites by a clear reversal of fracture transmissivity which correlates with contact metamorphic aureoles around Variscan granite intrusions (327–295 Ma). We hypothesize that this transmissivity increase is caused by processes accompanying granite intrusion and contact metamorphism. The thickness of these hydraulically active aureoles is greater in lower-grade metamorphic schist than in higher-grade metamorphic gneisses. Rock mass equivalent continuum conductivities have been estimated by arithmetic averaging of fracture and matrix transmissivities over 100 m intervals and have been converted to permeabilities. The median equivalent continuum permeability decreases with depth according to log(k) = − 1.7 * log(z) − 17.3 (k in m2 and increasing depth z in kilometer being positive). Matrix conductivity controls the bulk conductivity below about 1000 mbgs and is less sensitive to the occurrence of contact metamorphic aureoles.},

abstract = {Given the unique properties of clays (i.e., low permeability and high ion sorption/exchange capacity), clays or clay formations have been proposed either as an engineered material or as a geologic medium for nuclear waste isolation and disposal. A credible evaluation of such disposal systems relies on the ability to predict the behavior of these materials under a wide range of thermal-hydrological-mechanical-chemical (THMc) conditions. Current model couplings between THM and chemical processes are simplistic and limited in scope. This review focuses on the uptake of radionuclides onto clay materials as controlled by mineral composition, structure, and texture (e.g., pore size distribution), and emphasizes the connections between sorption chemistry and mechanical compaction. Variable uptake behavior of an array of elements has been observed on various clays as a function of increasing compaction due to changes in pore size and structure, hydration energy, and overlapping electric double layers. The causes for this variability are divided between {\{}$\backslash$textquotedbl{\}}internal{\{}$\backslash$textquotedbl{\}} (based on the fundamental structure and composition of the clay minerals) and {\{}$\backslash$textquotedbl{\}}external{\{}$\backslash$textquotedbl{\}} (caused by a force external to the clay). New techniques need to be developed to exploit known variations in clay mineralogy to separate internal from external effects.},

abstract = {Benchmark Test 3 (BMT3) of the international DECOVALEX III project has been designed to provide an illustrative example that explores the mechanical and hydraulic response of a fractured crystalline rock mass to a period of glaciation. The primary purpose of this numerical study is to investigate whether transient events associated with a glacial cycle could significantly influence the performance of a deep geological repository in a crystalline Shield setting. A conceptual site-scale (tens of kilometres) hydro-mechanical (HM) model was assembled based primarily on site-specific litho-structural, hydrogeological and geomechanical data from the Whiteshell Research Area on the Canadian Shield, with simplification and generalization to accommodate Fennoscandian Shield information. This site-scale HM model was driven by transient hydraulic and mechanical glaciated surface boundary conditions generated by the University of Edinburgh's continental-scale model of Laurentide ice-sheet history during the last glacial cycle, which lasted approximately 100 000 years. An overview of the BMT3 study has been presented in a companion paper (Chan T, Christiansson R, Boulton GS, Ericsson LO, Hartikainen J, Jensen MR, Mas Ivars D, Stanchell FW, Vidstrand P, Wallroth T.

This paper describes two- and three-dimensional coupled HM finite-element simulations with the MOTIF (Model Of Transport In Fractured/porous media) code. The mathematical and numerical modelling approaches are described and example results are presented to illustrate: (a) transient coupled modelling is necessary to capture the essence of glacial effects on groundwater flow system evolution; (b) fracture zone network geometry, interconnectivity and hydraulic properties significantly influence the magnitude and rate of flow domain response; and (c) model dimensionality can significantly affect simulated results.

abstract = {Subglacial groundwater flow was an integral part of glaciological systems of past ice sheets, but its impact on the origin of active-ice landforms remains unexplored. Using numerical experiments, we attempt to constrain groundwater flow dynamics under a major paleo-ice stream of the southern Scandinavian Ice Sheet and its impact on the formation of the Stargard drumlin field. Flow models show a total reorganization of groundwater dynamics under the advancing ice stream to a depth of up to {\~{}}200 m. A mosaic of intervening groundwater recharge and discharge areas originates, whereby the same areas may experience multiple shifts in flow directions. A prominent time- and space-transgressive pressure pump recharges groundwater in a subglacial zone up to about 20 km within the ice margin and discharges it in front of the ice sheet. The simulated groundwater flow pattern suggests that drumlins occupying a portion of the ice stream area occur preferentially where groundwater upwells and discharges at the ice/bed interface. Consistent with the geological composition, a possible drumlin-forming mechanism involves an excess of pressurized water under the ice reducing the strength of the subglacial deposits and facilitating glacial erosion, erosion by turbulent meltwater flows or both, streamlining antecedent deposits into drumlin shapes. This study emphasizes the importance of causal feedback between subglacial groundwater flow and the ice sheet dynamics and suggests an impact of the former on the formation of streamlined subglacial landforms in general.},

abstract = {The handling and safe disposal of spent fuel from nuclear power plants has been an issue since the 1950s when the first suggested method, geological storage in salt formations, was proposed in the US. Since then a number of methods have been developed for different types of bedrocks and waste types. One common need applicable to all these methods is to describe features and processes essential in repository design and demonstrations of long-term safety. So far, most methods have not described, nor emphasized, the importance of site-specific understanding of key parameters related to a specific repository design. Furthermore, the need of interdisciplinary research and the benefits gained when handling the site as a unified connected and mutually interrelated system (from bedrock to surface) have not been fully discussed. During a 30-year period, research has been performed in Sweden to demonstrate feasibility and long-term safety of underground geological disposal of spent nuclear fuel. In this paper, the overall strategy and discipline-specific modelling methods used in the site description of a final repository in Sweden are described, as exemplified by the Forsmark site. The resulting site description covers understanding of the historical evolution of the site, site data describing the current situation as well as spatially variable models needed to design the repository and evaluate long-term safety after closure. Finally, lessons learnt from this work are summarized, which are important when employing this method in the future. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract = {There is growing evidence that climate-induced melting of large ice sheets has been able to trigger fault reactivation and earthquakes around the migrating ice limit. Even today, the stress due to Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) can continue to induce seismicity within the once glaciated region. Northern Central Europe (NCE) lies outside the former ice margin and is regarded as a low seismicity area. However, several historic earthquakes with intensities of up to VII occurred in this region during the last 1,200 years. Here we show with numerical simulations that the seismicity can potentially be explained by the decay of the Scandinavian ice sheet (SIS) after the Weichselian glaciation. Combination of historic earthquake epicenters with fault maps relates historic seismicity to major reverse faults of Late Cretaceous age. Mesozoic normal faults remained inactive in historic times. We suggest that many faults in NCE are active during postglacial times. This is a novelty that sheds new light on the distribution of postglacial faulting and seismicity. In addition, we present the first consistent model that can explain both the occurrence of deglaciation seismicity and the historic earthquakes in NCE.},

On the other hand, we integrate material from the CLEAN project into this framework to demonstrate its applicability (K{\"{u}}hn et al. in Environ Earth Sci, this issue 2011). Benchmarks are an important instrument to gain a better understanding of interacting physico-chemical processes and they are a necessary tool to verify the algorithms and the software dedicated to simulate the separated and differently coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical/chemical processes during injecting and storing CO 2 in the subsurface. In general we distinguish between process- and site-related test cases. Process-related benchmarks deal with the required complexity of process coupling as well as equations of state for fluids and constitutive laws for geologic formations. Site-specific benchmarks represent different geological settings for potential CO 2 reservoirs, e. g., depleted gas and oil reservoirs as well as deep saline aquifers. The data basis for benchmarking mainly comes from experimental work in the CLEAN project as well as from literature. The benchmarking systematic is aimed at serving as basis for process studies, experimental design as well as for code inter-comparison purposes not only for numerical tools having used by the CLEAN partners but also for upcoming international benchmarking initiatives as well. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Like other countries, the UK has opted for deep geological disposal for the long-term, safe management of higher-activity radioactive waste. However, a site and a geological environment have yet to be identified to host a geological disposal facility. In considering its long-term safety functionality, it is necessary to consider natural processes, such as permafrost development, that have the potential to alter the geological environment over the time-scale of glacial-interglacial cycles. We applied a numerical model to simulate the impact of long-term climatic variability on groundwater flow and permafrost dynamics in two contrasting geological settings in Great Britain: (i) higher strength rocks (HSR) overlain by higher permeability sandstones with a high topographic gradient (GS1); (ii) a mixed sedimentary sequence of high and low permeability rocks resting on igneous HSR with a very low topographic gradient (GS2). We evaluated the sensitivity of simulated permafrost thickness to a variety of climatic and subsurface conditions. Uncertainty in the scaling of the surface temperature time-series, 10–25 °C below present day temperature, has the largest impact on maximum permafrost thickness, PF max , compared to other variables. However, considering plausible parameter ranges for UK settings, PF max is up to twice as sensitive to changes in thermal conductivity and geothermal heat flux than to changes in porosity. Heat advection only affects modelled PF max for high hydraulic conductivity rocks and if permafrost is considered to be relatively permeable. Whilst local differences in permafrost thickness of tens of meters, caused by variations in heat advection, are of minor importance over glacial-interglacial cycles, heat advection can be important in the development of taliks and the maintenance of a more active groundwater flow system. We conclude that it is likely to be important to simulate the effect of heat advection on coupled permafrost and groundwater flow systems in settings containing higher permeability lithological sequences.},

abstract = {A number of studies related to past and on-going deep repository performance assessments have identified glaciation/deglaciation as major future events in the next few hundred thousand years capable of causing significant impact on the long term performance of the repository system. Benchmark Test 3 (BMT3) of the international DECOVALEX III project has been designed to provide an illustrative example that explores the mechanical and hydraulic response of a fractured crystalline rock mass to a period of glaciation. The primary purpose of this numerical study is to investigate whether transient events associated with a glacial cycle could significantly influence the performance of a deep geological repository in a crystalline Shield setting. A conceptual site-scale (tens of kilometres) hydro-mechanical (HM) model was assembled based primarily on site-specific litho-structural, hydrogeological and geomechanical data from the Whiteshell Research Area in the Canadian Shield, with simplification and generalization. Continental glaciological modelling of the Laurentide ice sheet through the last glacial cycle lasting approximately 100,000 years suggests that this site was glaciated at about 60 ka and between about 22.5 and 11 ka before present with maximum ice sheet thickness reaching 2500 m and maximum basal water pressure head reaching 2000 m. The ice-sheet/drainage model was scaled down to generate spatially and temporally variable hydraulic and mechanical glaciated surface boundary conditions for site-scale subsurface HM modelling and permafrost modelling. Under extreme periglacial conditions permafrost was able to develop down to the assumed 500-m repository horizon. Two- and three-dimensional coupled HM finite-element simulations indicate: during ice-sheet advance there is rapid rise in hydraulic head, high transient hydraulic gradients and high groundwater velocities 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than under nonglacial conditions; surface water recharges deeper than under nonglacial conditions; upon ice-sheet retreat, the gradients reverse; fracture zone network geometry, interconnectivity and hydraulic properties significantly influence flow domain response; residual elevated heads are preserved for 10,000 s in the low-diffusivity rock; and no hydraulic jacking or shear failure occurs at depth. It was found that transient coupled modelling is necessary to capture the essence of glacial effects on Performance Assessment. Model dimensionality also significantly affects simulated results.

abstract = {Geochemical conditions in intracratonic sedimentary basins are currently reducing, even at relatively shallow depths. However, during glaciation-deglaciation events, glacial meltwater production may result in enhanced recharge (Bea et al., 2011; and Bea et al., 2016) potentially having high concentrations of dissolved oxygen (O2). In this study, the reactive transport code Par-MIN3PTHCm was used to perform an informed, illustrative set of simulations assessing the depth of penetration of low salinity, O2-rich, subglacial recharge. Simulation results indicate that the large-scale basin hydrostratigraphy, in combination with the presence of dense brines at depth, results in low groundwater velocities during glacial meltwater infiltration, restricting the vertical ingress of dilute recharge waters. Furthermore, several geochemical attenuation mechanisms exist for O2, which is consumed by reactions with reduced mineral phases and solid organic matter (SOM). The modeling showed that effective oxidative mineral dissolution rates and SOMoxidation rates between 5 × 10-15 and 6 × 10-13 mol dm-3 bulk s-1 were sufficient to restrict the depth of O2 ingress to less than 200m.These effective rates are low and thus conservative, in comparison to rates reported in the literature. Additional simulations with more realistic, yet still conservative, parameters reaffirm the limited ability for O2 to penetrate into sedimentary basin rocks during a glaciation-deglaciation event.},

abstract = {Different modelling tools, including COMSOL Multiphysics{\textregistered} (COMSOL) finite element method (FEM) simulation software can be used in understanding complex thermal and hydrogeological effects. COMSOL was used to simulate the conductive heat transfer with phase change in the geological formations encompassed in permafrost surrounding a shallow thaw lake. The purpose of the simulation was to verify the adequacy of COMSOL to model such phenomena by comparing the COMSOL results to those obtained by another FEM model (Ling and Zhang, 2003). The graphical comparison of the simulation results show that they are in agreement with those published by Ling and Zhang (2003). In light of the obtained results, COMSOL can be used to adequately model the time-dependent conductive heat transfer with phase change and assess the thaw effects due to a shallow thaw lake over continuous permafrost. The verification of this study provides evidence that the COMSOL code can be applied to more complex multiphysics problems. This includes the modelling of coupled heat transfer (conduction and convection with phase change) and groundwater flow in order to determine the thaw effects surrounding a uranium in-pit TMF in continuous permafrost.},

abstract = {The injection of cold CO2 is modelled in three dimensions using a two-stage coupled thermoporoelastic model, with the aim of evaluating changes in apertures and potential growth of fractures. Non-isothermal flow is considered within the fractures and the rock matrix, and the two flow domains are coupled through a mass transfer term. The numerical model has been developed using standard finite elements, with spatial discretisation achieved using the Galerkin method, and temporal discretisation using finite differences. A full-scale field case geometric model, based on the Goldeneye depleted hydrocarbon reservoir in the North Sea, is developed and used for simulations. The in situ faults are modelled discretely as discontinuous surfaces in a three-dimensional matrix, including basement, reservoir, caprock and overburden layers. The faults are assumed initially to be low-permeable faults, with the same permeability as the caprock. However, the simulations show that their apertures (and as a result, their permeabilities) vary due to the thermoporoelastic effects caused by the injection of the relatively cold CO2. The change in the fracture apertures is mainly due to thermal effects; the reservoir layer undergoes contractions due to the cooling, significantly increasing fault aperture in the region of the fault within the reservoir, whereas the fault aperture is reduced in regions within the caprock. Propagation of fractures under thermoporoelastic loading is investigated. Results show that the distance to the injection well, as well as spatial orientation of fractures with respect to the injection well, affect aperture evolution and potential growth of fractures. A sensitivity analysis is performed on the parameters affecting the fracture growth: minimum normal stress acting on the fracture plane, dip angle of the fracture, and the contact friction coefficient. It is found that low friction, low normal contact stress, or high in situ shear stress on the fracture surfaces may trigger propagation under combined mode II and III within the reservoir layer, or at the interface of the reservoir and caprock.},

abstract = {A comprehensive dataset for discrete groundwater inflows to mines in the Poehla-Tellerhaeuser Ore Field and the mining scale fault zones has been compiled from unpublished data recorded by eastern German and Soviet hydrogeologists at the Soviet-German stock company (SDAG) Wismut. This dataset has been analyzed to provide novel insights into the 3D distribution of preferential groundwater pathways and the impacts of faulting on the distribution of hydraulic parameters in crystalline rocks at site scale. The sampled 1030 discrete inflows include flow rates ranging from 1.7E-8 to 3.7E-2 m3 sec−1, which were transformed into mesoscale fracture transmissivity values ranging between 3E-13 and 2E-4 m2 sec−1. These mesoscale fracture transmissivities were spatially correlated with fault zones exhibiting trace lengths between 0.3 and 30 km, which were mainly formed during and reactivated several times since Variscan orogeny. The statistical correlations are based on a 3D geological model composed of 14 litho-stratigraphic units and 131 mining scale faults, separated into five main strike directions. These fault zones strongly overlap and cover about 90{\%} of the investigated rock mass volume with a decreasing percentage of overlap in the investigated depth range (0–900 mbgs). 97{\%} of all inflows are located within fault damage zones, and most of the flow occurs within the overlap of multiple fault damage zones. A dimensionless hydraulic model for the distribution of flow Q as a function of the position x within mining scale fault zones has been derived as Q = 1.1e−4.5x (where x decreases from the fault core to the protolith and the exponent varies as a function of fault orientation). 75–95{\%} of the flow occurs within the inner 50{\%} of the damage zone, and mainly NW-SE and NE-SW striking mining scale faults are transmissive. The orientations of conductive mesoscale fractures within these damage zones show a larger variability than the corresponding mining scale faults.},

abstract = {Pleistocene glaciation led to temporal and spatial variations of sub-surface pore fluid pressure. In basins covered by ice sheets, fluid flow and recharge rates are strongly elevated during glaciations as compared to inter-glacial periods. Present-day hydrogeological conditions across formerly glaciated areas are likely to still reflect the impact of glaciations that ended locally more than 10 thousand years before present.3D hydro-mechanical coupled modelling of glaciation can help to improve the management of groundwater resources in formerly glaciated basins.An open source numerical code for solving linear elasticity, which is based on the finite element method (FEM) in 3D, has been developed. By coupling this code with existing 3D flow codes it is possible to enable hydro-mechanical coupled modelling.Results of two benchmark simulations are compared to existing analytical solutions to demonstrate the performance of the newly developed code. While the result for a fluid-structure coupled case is in reasonable agreement with the analytical model, the result for a classical structure-fluid coupled benchmark showed that the analytical solution only matches the numerical result when the relevant coupling parameter (loading efficiency) is known in advance. This indicates that the applicability of widely applied approaches using an extra term in the groundwater flow equation for vertical stress to simulate hydro-mechanical coupling might have to be re-evaluated.A case study with the commercial groundwater simulator FEFLOW demonstrates the newly developed solution. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Mean and median fracture transmissivities exhibit a complex trend with depth in a heavily faulted metamorphic rock environment. The general trend of decreasing transmissivities with depth can be explained by increasing overburden stress and non-linear fracture stiffness and exhibits differences between low grade and high grade metamorphic/intrusive rocks. At depth, conductive fracture transmissivities are increasingly dominated by contact metamorphic aureoles around Variscan intrusions. These cause a reversal in the transmissivity-depth trend and are caused by more brittle hornfelses in the inner contact metamorphic aureole. The extension of the hydraulically effective aureole is higher for lower grade schists and phyllites than in higher grade gneisses. The median equivalent continuum rock mass conductivity is mainly controlled by the increase of spacing of transmissive fractures rather than increasing transmissivities around intrusions and therefore is independent from contact metamorphism. With increasing depth, flow through the matrix blocks and therefore the primary (lithology dependent) porosity of the protolith becomes progressively more important},

abstract = {In the recent literature, it has been shown that Pleistocene glaciations had a large impact on North American regional groundwater flow systems. Because of the myriad of complex processes and large spatial scales involved during periods of glaciation, numerical models have become powerful tools to examine how ice sheets control subsurface flow systems. In this paper, the key processes that must be represented in a continental-scale 3-D numerical model of groundwater flow during a glaciation are reviewed, including subglacial infiltration, density-dependent (i.e., high-salinity) groundwater flow, permafrost evolution, isostasy, sea level changes, and ice sheet loading. One-dimensional hydromechanical coupling associated with ice loading and brine generation were included in the numerical model HydroGeoSphere and tested against newly developed exact analytical solutions to verify their implementation. Other processes such as subglacial infiltration, permafrost evolution, and isostasy were explicitly added to HydroGeoSphere. A specified flux constrained by the ice sheet thickness was found to be the most appropriate boundary condition in the subglacial environment. For the permafrost, frozen and unfrozen elements can be selected at every time step with specified hydraulic conductivities. For the isostatic adjustment, the elevations of all the grid nodes in each vertical grid column below the ice sheet are adjusted uniformly to account for the Earth's crust depression and rebound. In a companion paper, the model is applied to the Wisconsinian glaciation over the Canadian landscape in order to illustrate the concepts developed in this paper and to better understand the impact of glaciation on 3-D continental groundwater flow systems.},

abstract = {The main objective of this article is to investigate the influence of individual fractures on each other in a multi-fracture system, including space optimization, by using the FDM program FLAC3Dvlui featuring own developments, which treats all fractures in a single 3D geometric model, under a 3D stress state taking hydro-mechanical coupling effects into consideration. A case study was conducted on a horizontal wellbore at location A, which was simulated hydrauli cally with a total of eight transverse fractures in summer 2009. Transverse multiple fractures were simulated using the modified continuum method. In the simulation all fractures were generated in one single model, comprising 22 different rock layers. Each layer was assumed to be homogeneous with regard to its rock and hydro-mechanical parameters. Thus the influence of the individual fractures on each other can be investigated. The simulation procedure applied, which is a consecutive execution of a hydraulic and a mechanical computation, is the same for all fractures. The only differences are the primary in-situ stresses, the initial pore pressure, the injection parameters (location, rate, volume, duration), which lead to different patterns of fracture propagations. But there are still some common points, such as irregular patterns of the fracture front, which represents the heterogeneity of the model. All fractures (1 to 8) have their fracture average halflength between 70 m and 115 m, height 93 m to 114 m and average width 18 mm to 31 mm. The percentage difference of fracture height for individual fractures is obviously smaller than that of the fracture halflengths, because the fracture barriers at the bottom and especially at the top of a reservoir limit the fracture propagation in z-direction. In comparison with the semi-analytical simulator (FracPro) most results match well. Simulation of multiple fractures at location A, with the newly developed algorithms, shows that individual transverse multiple fractures at distances between !`00-150 m will certainly have an influence on each other in terms of the stress change, but not pore pressure. Generally this influence as simulated at this location has a positive effect on the fracture geometry as well, and may lead to a bigger half-length and a smaller width of fracture. In order to maximize the production rate at this specific site, transverse multiple fractures with an optimal fracture distance ofca. 57 m should be implemented. This optimal fracture spacing is derived from the contour of 5° direction change of the primary maximum horizontal stress, to ensure that only transverse fractures are generated at this location. However, the influence on longitudinal multiple fractures is very obvious, as observed from the numerical simulations of longitudinal multiple fractures at location B. Under the circumstances, it is recommended that the boreholes should not be drilled exactly in the direction of maximal horizontal stress ({\$}\backslashpm{\$}15°), in order to avoid the overlapping of fractures.},

abstract = {Underground research laboratories (URLs), including "generic URLs" and "site-specific URLs", are underground facilities in which characterisation, testing, technology development, and/or demonstration activities are carried out in support of the development of geological repositories for high-level radioactive waste (HLW) disposal. In addition to the generic URL and site-specific URL, a concept of "area-specific URL", or the third type of URL, is proposed in this paper. It is referred to as the facility that is built at a site within an area that is considered as a potential area for HLW repository or built at a place near the future repository site, and may be regarded as a precursor to the development of a repository at the site. It acts as a "generic URL", but also acts as a "site-specific URL" to some extent. Considering the current situation in China, the most suitable option is to build an "area-specific URL" in Beishan area, the first priority region for China's high-level waste repository. With this strategy, the goal to build China's URL by 2020 may be achieved, but the time left is limited. ?? 2014 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

The most abundant rock type is migmatic mica gneiss, intruded by tonalites, granodiorites and granites. Response of bedrock at Olkiluoto site was modelled with 3DEC program considering four future ice age scenarios. Each scenario produces shear displacements of fractures with different time of occurrence and varying recovery rate. Generally, the larger the maximum ice load, the larger the permanent shear displacements will be. For basic case, the maximum shear displacements were few centimeters at suggested nuclear waste repository level. The sensitivity study performed showed that shear stiffness and joint friction angle of bedrock structures are the most critical parameters for bedrock displacements. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Multiple fractures have been proposed for improving the heat extracted from an enhanced geothermal system (EGS). For calculating the production temperature of a multi-fracture EGS, previous analytical or semi-analytical methods have all been based on an infinite scale of fractures and one-dimensional conduction in the rock matrix. Here, a temporal semi-analytical method is presented in which finite-scale fractures and three-dimensional conduction in the rock matrix are both considered. Firstly, the developed model was validated by comparing it with the analytical solution, which only considers one-dimensional conduction in the rock matrix. Then, the temporal semi-analytical method was used to predict the production temperature in order to investigate the effects of fracture spacing and fracture number on the response of an EGS with a constant total injection rate. The results demonstrate that enlarging the spacing between fractures and increasing the number of fractures can both improve the heat extraction; however, the latter approach is much more effective than the former. In addition, the temporal semi-analytical method is applicable for optimizing the design of an EGS with multiple fractures located equidistantly or non-equidistantly.},

abstract = {A 3-D groundwater flow and brine transport numerical model of the entire Canadian landscape up to a depth of 10 km is constructed in order to capture the impacts of the Wisconsinian glaciation on the continental groundwater flow system. The numerical development of the model is presented in the companion paper of Lemieux et al. (2008b). Although the scale of the model prevents the use of a detailed geological model, commonly occurring geological materials that exhibit relatively consistent hydrogeological properties over the continent justify the simplifications while still allowing the capture of large-scale flow system trends. The model includes key processes pertaining to coupled groundwater flow and glaciation modeling, such a density-dependent (i.e., brine) flow, hydromechanical loading, subglacial infiltration, isostasy, and permafrost development. The surface boundary conditions are specified with the results of a glacial system model. The significant impact of the ice sheet on groundwater flow is evident by increases in the hydraulic head values below the ice sheet by as much as 3000 m down to a depth of 1.5 km into the subsurface. Results also indicate that the groundwater flow system after glaciation did not fully revert to its initial condition and that it is still recovering from the glaciation perturbation. This suggests that the current groundwater flow system cannot be interpreted solely on the basis of present-day boundary conditions and it is likely that several thousands of years of additional equilibration time will be necessary for the system to reach a new quasi-steady state. Finally, we find permafrost to have a large impact on the rate of dissipation of high hydraulic heads that build at depth and capturing its accurate distribution is important to explain the current hydraulic head distribution across the Canadian landscape.},

abstract = {A large-scale underground thermal test (Drift Scale Test--DST) in fractured volcanic tuff resulted in changes to water and gas chemistry as well as mineral precipitation and dissolution in fractures. Thermal, hydrological, and chemical (THC) processes in the DST were modeled by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ``LBNL'' and Japan Nuclear Cycle Development Institute ``JNC'' as part of the international working group DECOVALEX. Predictions of THC processes in the DST for the 4-year heating and 4-year cooling periods were initially performed by the LBNL group, with the current model reflecting a revised heater operation history and model. JNC used primarily the original data from the prediction and created a new model to evaluate a selected set of data. The approaches taken by the groups differed in several ways and a comparison of the methodologies and results of the simulations allow for a better understanding of modeling coupled processes in unsaturated fractured rock. The LBNL model represented the fractures and rock matrix as a fully interacting dual-continuum (in terms of fluid, heat, and chemical transport) with the local mineral--water--gas reactions treated by kinetic and equilibrium reactions. The JNC model represented the fractures and matrix as a single effective continuum, with equilibrium mineral-water reactions controlling the chemical evolution. Both models considered aqueous species transport, with gas phase CO2 transport only considered in the LBNL model. Comparisons to data collected from the DST illustrate the behavior of the models and their ability to capture the relevant THC processes. Overall, both models capture the temperature evolution in the rock quite closely, although the JNC model gave a closer match to the initial temperature rise in the rock, likely owing to the use of site-specific thermal data as opposed to average properties used for the LBNL model. Both models showed the contrasting solubility effects of increasing temperature on calcite and silica solubility; yet the dual-continuum approach better represented the effects of boiling and condensation on aqueous species chemistry and the distribution of mineral precipitation.},

abstract = {The International Atomic Energy Agency has coordinated an international project addressing climate change and landscape development in post-closure safety assessments of solid radioactive waste disposal. The work has been supported by results of parallel on-going research that has been published in a variety of reports and peer reviewed journal articles. The project is due to be described in detail in a forthcoming IAEA report. Noting the multi-disciplinary nature of post-closure safety assessments, here, an overview of the work is given to provide researchers in the broader fields of radioecology and radiological safety assessment with a review of the work that has been undertaken. It is hoped that such dissemination will support and promote integrated understanding and coherent treatment of climate change and landscape development within an overall assessment process. The key activities undertaken in the project were: identification of the key processes that drive environmental change (mainly those associated with climate and climate change), and description of how a relevant future may develop on a global scale; development of a methodology for characterising environmental change that is valid on a global scale, showing how modelled global changes in climate can be downscaled to provide information that may be needed for characterising environmental change in site-specific assessments, and illustrating different aspects of the methodology in a number of case studies that show the evolution of site characteristics and the implications for the dose assessment models. Overall, the study has shown that quantitative climate and landscape modelling has now developed to the stage that it can be used to define an envelope of climate and landscape change scenarios at specific sites and under specific greenhouse-gas emissions assumptions that is suitable for use in quantitative post-closure performance assessments. These scenarios are not predictions of the future, but are projections based on a well-established understanding of the important processes involved and their impacts on different types of landscape. Such projections support the understanding of, and selection of, plausible ranges of scenarios for use in post-closure safety assessments.},

abstract = {This report provides a 2D numerical estimation of site-specific spatial- and temporal development of permafrost and perennially frozen ground at Forsmark. The study complements the 1D permafrost study that was made for the SR-Can safety assessment / SKB 2006/. When considering environ- mental conditions (i.e. ice sheets, shore-line displacement and air temperature curve) for the initial 45,000 years of the reconstructed Weichselian glacial cycle, the maximum permafrost depth (the 0°C isotherm) over the repository can vary between 180 and 260 m, and the depth of perennially frozen ground (ground remaining frozen for at least two consecutive years) between 180 and 250 m depend- ing on the surface conditions. Spatially permafrost distribution turns to continuous state (more than 90{\%} coverage) when annual mean air temperature decreases below –6°C and the maximum permafrost depth at the site exceeds a depth of {\~{}}50 m. When considering a severe permafrost case consisting of a full 115,000 year long glacial cycle assuming no cover of ice sheet, vegetation, snow, or sea, the maximum permafrost depth over the repository varies between 360 and 390 m and the depth of perennially frozen ground between 330 and 360 m. Groundwater flow may take place through a perennially frozen ground within a continuous perma- frost zone when the unfrozen groundwater content in the perennially frozen ground exceeds 10{\%}, thus allowing for talik formation under lakes at Forsmark. When the unfrozen groundwater content decreases below 10{\%}, groundwater flow is reduced considerably, and taliks are no longer able to form or survive. In the conducted permafrost simulations, through-taliks are formed under specific time periods beneath two future lakes that will form at the Forsmark site along the investigated profile. Freezing can induce salt exclusion and transport when perennially frozen ground develops deeper than {\~{}}200 m at Forsmark. In addition, salinity concentration of groundwater is increased within the perennially frozen ground, if salt transport occurrs more slowly then the freezing zone advances.},

abstract = {The hydrodynamic consequences of a glaciation/deglaciation cycle within an intercratonic sedimentary basin on subsurface transport processes is assessed using numerical models. In our analysis we consider the effects of mechanical ice sheet loading, permafrost formation, variable density fluids, and lithospheric flexure on solute/isotope transport, groundwater residence times, and transient hydraulic head distributions. The simulations are intended to apply, in a generic sense, to intercratonic sedimentary basins that would have been near the southern limit of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the last glacial maximum (∼20 ka B.P.), such as the Williston, Michigan, and Illinois basins. We show that in such basins fluid flow and recharge rates are strongly elevated during glaciation as compared to nonglacial periods. Furthermore, our results illustrate that steady state hydrodynamic conditions in these basins are probably never reached during a 32.5 ka cycle of advance and retreat of a wet-based ice sheet. Present-day hydrogeological conditions across formerly glaciated areas are likely to still reflect the impact of the last glaciation and associated processes that ended locally more than 10 ka B.P. Our results reveal characteristic spatial patterns of underpressure and overpressure that occur in aquitards and aquifers, respectively, as a result of recent glaciation. The calculated emplacement of low salinity, isotopically light glacial meltwater along basin margins is roughly consistent with observations from formerly glaciated basins in North America. The modeling presented in this study will help to improve the management of groundwater resources in formerly glaciated basins as well as to evaluate the viability on geological timescales of nuclear waste repositories located at high latitudes.

abstract = {We reconstruct patterns of subglacial processes on a hard bedrock and a soft bed under the southern sector of Scandinavian Ice Sheet (SIS) occurring in the basal till of the Late Saalian Glaciation at the Wapienno, Barcin and M{\l}odocin sites (north-central Poland). Based on detailed sedimentological studies, two phases of SIS transgression were recognised. In the initial phase of the transgression, the SIS advanced onto a frozen substrate (continuous permafrost). The low permeability of the substratum led to a high subglacial water pressure (SWP) and increased basal sliding. The local increase of SWP led to the development of different types of structures and sediments. On a hard bedrock, with low SWP, abrasion predominated and linear structures were developing, while in the case of high SWP, the ice was decoupled from the hard substrate, pressurised liquefied sediment flowed, and structures of the p-form and s-form type developed. On a soft bed, the ice-bed contact was of a mosaic type and the ice movement had an ice-stream character. The ice-stream developed towards the east in the marginal zone of the SIS and used a W-E oriented valley filled by the Wapienno Formation fluvial complex. During a later phase, the ice movement was slower and did not have a stream character. Its direction changed to SE. The deposition of the main part of the diamicton occurred mainly as a result of the lodgement process.},

@article{Walvoord2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} Soil Science Society of America. Where present, permafrost exerts a primary control on water fluxes, flow-paths, and distribution. Climate warming and related drivers of soil thermal change are expected to modify the distribution of permafrost, leading to changing hydrologic conditions, including alterations in soil moisture, connectivity of inland waters, streamflow seasonality, and the partitioning of water stored above and below ground. The field of permafrost hydrology is undergoing rapid advancement with respect to multiscale observations, subsurface characterization, modeling, and integration with other disciplines. However, gaining predictive capability of the many interrelated consequences of climate change is a persistent challenge due to several factors. Observations of hydrologic change have been causally linked to permafrost thaw, but applications of process-based models needed to support and enhance the transferability of empirical linkages have often been restricted to generalized representations. Limitations stem from inadequate baseline permafrost and unfrozen hydrogeologic characterization, lack of historical data, and simplifications in structure and process representation needed to counter the high computational demands of cryohydrogeologic simulations. Further, due in part to the large degree of subsurface heterogeneity of permafrost landscapes and the nonuniformity in thaw patterns and rates, associations between various modes of permafrost thaw and hydrologic change are not readily scalable; even trajectories of change can differ. This review highlights promising advances in characterization and modeling of permafrost regions and presents ongoing research challenges toward projecting hydrologic and ecologic consequences of permafrost thaw at time and spatial scales that are useful to managers and researchers.},

abstract = {Glaciological observations of under-flooding suggest that fluid-induced hydraulic fracture of an ice sheet from its bed sometimes occurs quickly, possibly driven by turbulently flowing water in a broad sheet flow. Taking the approximation of a fully turbulent flow into an elastic ice medium with small fracture toughness, we derive an approximate expression for the crack-tip speed, opening displacement and pressure profile. We accomplish this by first showing that a Manning-Strickler channel model for resistance to turbulent flow leads to a mathematical structure somewhat similar to that for resistance to laminar flow of a power law viscous fluid. We then adapt the plane-strain asymptotic crack solution of Desroches et al. (1994) and the power law self-similar solution of Adachi and Detournay (2002) for that case to calculate the desired quantities. The speed of crack growth is shown to scale as the overpressure (in excess of ice overburden) to the power 7/6, inversely as ice elastic modulus to the power 2/3, and as the ratio of crack length to wall roughness scale to the power 1/6. We tentatively apply our model by choosing parameter values thought appropriate for a basal crack driven by the rapid drainage of a surface meltwater lake near the margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Making various approximations perhaps relevant to this setting, we estimate fluid inflow rate to the basal fracture and vertical and horizontal surface displacements and find order-of-magnitude agreement with observations by Das et al. (2008) associated with lake drainage. Finally, we discuss how these preliminary estimates could be improved.Copyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Topographic perturbation of ambient stress fields can produce vertically and laterally varying subsurface stresses, which can influence the abundance, openness, and orientations of bedrock fractures at depth. The stress state on bedrock fractures can affect the permeability of bedrock, produce non-uniform groundwater flow paths, and affect the rate and distribution of surface processes. In this study, we examine the connections among topographic stress, bedrock fractures, and hydraulic conductivity in Forsmark, Sweden. This area provides an excellent opportunity to study these connections because it has strong horizontal compression ({\~{}} 20 MPa) and there are extensive geophysical and hydrogeological datasets available as a result of ongoing investigations of Forsmark as a potential nuclear waste repository site. Previous studies suggested that the strong ambient compressive stresses are probably from regional tectonic stresses or spatial and temporal changes of ice loads. We calculate topographic perturbations of subsurface ambient stress fields in the area surrounding Forsmark using a three-dimensional boundary element model. We use high-resolution topographic maps of the land surface and bedrock surface as zero-traction boundary conditions and apply ambient stress conditions inferred from more than 100 in-situ stress measurements from overcoring and hydro-fracturing. We consider the effects of ice and sediment loads and pore water pressure. Our preliminary results show that the topographic perturbation of the stress fields can extend to 200 m below the surface despite low topographic relief (e.g., {\~{}}20 m), which is due in part to the strong, anisotropic ambient compressive stress. The calculated stress distribution is consistent with the observed distribution of hydraulically conductive, sub-horizontal fractures from 23 deep boreholes and has implications for groundwater flow and glacial erosion in the region.},

abstract = {Im Juni 2001 wurde zwischen dem Bundesministerium f{\"{u}}r Wirtschaft und Technologie (BMWi, jetzt BMWA) der Bundesrepublik Deutschland und dem Ministerium f{\"{u}}r Atomenergie (MINATOM, jetzt ROSATOM) der Russischen F{\"{o}}deration die Neuaufnahme der wissenschaftlichen Kooperation auf dem Gebiet der Endlagerforschung im Rahmen des Abkommens beider L{\"{a}}nder {\"{u}}ber die wissenschaftlich-technische Zusammenarbeit bei der friedlichen Nutzung der Kernenergie vom 22.04.1987 vereinbart und eine Reihe gemeinsamer Projekte zur Endlagerforschung abgestimmt. In dem vorliegenden Abschlussbericht werden die im Zeitraum Januar 2002 – Dezember 2004 erzielten Ergebnisse zu zwei dieser Projekte • B2 Untersuchungen zur Endlagerung hochradioaktiver Abf{\"{a}}lle in tiefen Granitformationen • B3 Untersuchungen zur Endlagerung hochradioaktiver und w{\"{a}}rmeentwickelnder verglaster Abf{\"{a}}lle in tiefen Porphyrformationen zusammengefasst. Beide Projekte wurden auf deutscher Seite im Rahmen des vom BMWA gef{\"{o}}rderten Forschungsvorhabens „Anforderungen an die Standorterkundung f{\"{u}}r HAW-Endlager im Hartgestein (ASTER)“ von der DBE TECHNOLOGY GmbH, der BGR und der GRS mbH bearbeitet. Das von ROSATOM daf{\"{u}}r festgelegte Institut VNIPI Promtechnologii war an diesem Forschungsvorhaben auf vertraglicher Grundlage beteiligt und bezog weitere russische Forschungseinrichtungen ein. Zielstellung des Forschungsvorhabens war es, einen methodischen Ansatz zu entwickeln, der zu einem fundierten Standorterkundungs- und -auswahlprogramm f{\"{u}}hrt, das auf die f{\"{u}}r die Belange der Endlagersicherheit wesentlichen Aspekte ausgerichtet ist. Die Besonderheit dieser Aufgabenstellung besteht darin, dass bereits in einer fr{\"{u}}hen Phase der Standorterkundung und Endlagerplanung die Frage nach dem tats{\"{a}}chlichen geowissenschaftlichen Informationsbedarf f{\"{u}}r eine Sicherheitsbewertung gestellt wird, den die weitere Standorterkundung decken soll. So wird - abweichend von der g{\"{a}}ngigen Praxis einer m{\"{o}}glichst umfassenden und damit aufw{\"{a}}ndigen Standortcharakterisierung - die Konzentration auf ein zielorientiertes Erkundungsprogramm erm{\"{o}}glicht. Zwischen den deutschen und russischen Partnern wurde vereinbart, dass das Vorhaben am Beispiel der von russischer Seite seit l{\"{a}}ngerer Zeit untersuchten potenziellen Endlagergebiete f{\"{u}}r radioaktive Abf{\"{a}}lle im Raum Krasnojarsk (Granitoidformation) und in der Umgebung der im S{\"{u}}dural gelegenen Produktionsvereinigung Majak (Porphyritformation) bearbeitet wird, wobei der Standort Krasnojarsk aufgrund der Interessenslage der russischen Seite Vorrang hat. Die im vorliegenden Bericht dargelegten Ergebnisse der Forschungsarbeiten zum Projekt B2 bez{\"{u}}glich eines Endlagers in einer Granitoidformation k{\"{o}}nnen wie folgt zusammengefasst werden: In einem ersten Schritt wurden die zu derzeit betrachteten zwei potenziellen Standorten vorliegenden umfangreichen Informationen zur Standortcharakterisierung und zum vorgesehenen Endlagerinventar ausgewertet und entsprechend den inhaltlichen Aufgabenstellungen des Forschungsvorhabens systematisiert. In den Kapiteln 1 und 2 sind die Ergebnisse dieser Datenzusammenstellung und –aufbereitung dargestellt. Ungeachtet einer Reihe von Problemen bez{\"{u}}glich der Vollst{\"{a}}ndigkeit der erforderlichen standortbezogenen Untersuchungsergebnisse und der Art der Datenbereitstellung bildeten diese eine hinreichende Grundlage f{\"{u}}r die weiteren 4 Arbeitsschritte. Ein besonderes Problem stellten die stark variierende Kartenma{\ss}st{\"{a}}be, M{\"{a}}ngel in der Pr{\"{a}}zision bei der Erstellung der Karten sowie fehlende Ortskoordinaten in den auf deutscher Seite verf{\"{u}}gbaren Unterlagen dar. Bisher wurde noch keine komplexe Interpretation der bisher gewonnenen geowissenschaftlichen Erkundungsdaten vorgenommen. Als ein hilfreiches Instrument bei der Beherrschung des umfangreichen Datenpools hat sich die {\"{U}}berf{\"{u}}hrung der Daten und Informationen in ein Geoinformationssystem erwiesen, das einen schnellen Zugriff auf die Daten und deren komplexe Bearbeitung erm{\"{o}}glicht. Bei fehlenden oder unzureichenden Daten, die f{\"{u}}r die Entwicklung eines Endlagerkonzepts sowie f{\"{u}}r eine erste Sicherheitsanalyse des Endlagers erforderlich waren, wurden anhand der internationalen Literatur begr{\"{u}}ndete Annahmen getroffen und zwischen den Projektpartnern abgestimmt. Auf der Grundlage dieser Daten und Informationen wurde ein generisches Endlagerkonzept f{\"{u}}r die Nishnekansker Granitoidformation im Gebiet Krasnojarsk entwickelt (s. Kap. 3). Dabei wurde die Endlagerung von stark w{\"{a}}rmeentwickelnden Abf{\"{a}}llen in untert{\"{a}}gig abgeteuften Bohrl{\"{o}}chern und von schwach w{\"{a}}rmeentwickelnden in horizontalen Strecken vorgesehen. Die durchgef{\"{u}}hrten thermischen Berechnungen zum konzipierten Endlager zeigen, dass aufgrund der au{\ss}erordentlich hohen W{\"{a}}rmeentwicklung von bestimmten Abfallgebinden, die in der Anfangszeit bei weitem die in Deutschland und anderen L{\"{a}}ndern zugrundegelegte W{\"{a}}rmeabgabe von Endlagergebinden {\"{u}}berschreitet, besondere technische Ma{\ss}nahmen erforderlich sind, um die Integrit{\"{a}}t der technischen Barrieren zu gew{\"{a}}hrleisten und die thermische Beeinflussung des Wirtsgesteins auf ein zul{\"{a}}ssiges Ma{\ss} zu begrenzen. Dazu wurde eine thermische Isolationsschicht zwischen den Abfallbeh{\"{a}}ltern und der technischen Barriere Bentonitbuffer vorgeschlagen. Die dazu durchgef{\"{u}}hrten thermischen Parameter-Variationsrechnungen haben gezeigt, dass bei Auswahl von Materialien f{\"{u}}r den Bentonit und den thermischen Isolator mit bestimmten w{\"{a}}rmephysikalischen Kenndaten, die Integrit{\"{a}}t der Bentonitbarriere gew{\"{a}}hrleistet werden kann und auch eine {\"{U}}berhitzung des Abfallbeh{\"{a}}lters und der Abfallmatrix vermieden wird. Diese neu entwickelte technische L{\"{o}}sung erm{\"{o}}glicht die Endlagerung von w{\"{a}}rmeentwickelnden Abfallgebinden mit hoher Anfangsw{\"{a}}rmeleistung bei annehmbaren Zwischenlagerzeiten sowie eine relativ kompakte Anordnung der Abfallgebinde im Endlager. Sie kann auch f{\"{u}}r Endlagerkonzepte in anderen Wirtsgesteinen eingesetzt werden, wo zur Gew{\"{a}}hrleistung der Barrierenintegrit{\"{a}}t Temperaturbegrenzungen gesetzt werden m{\"{u}}ssen. In Kapitel 4 ist die Bewertung der Endlagersicherheit mit Hilfe eines Systems von Modellen f{\"{u}}r das Nah- bzw. Fernfeld zur Analyse der Grundwasserstr{\"{o}}mung, der Radionuklidausbreitung und der Beeinflussung der Biosph{\"{a}}re detailliert beschrieben und es werden die Ergebnisse der durchgef{\"{u}}hrten Modellrechnungen vorgestellt. Um insbesondere die Sensitivit{\"{a}}t von Ver{\"{a}}nderungen des Kluftsystems, des nat{\"{u}}rlichen W{\"{a}}rmefeldes sowie des Endlagerkonzeptes und der Beh{\"{a}}lterstandzeit auf den Radionuklidtransport zu bewerten, wurde eine Vielzahl von Variationsrechnungen durchgef{\"{u}}hrt. Die Modellierungen haben gezeigt, dass die Grundwasserstr{\"{o}}mung und der Schadstofftransport in gekl{\"{u}}ftetem Gestein im Wesentlichen von den hydraulischen Durchl{\"{a}}ssigkeiten der Gesteinsmatrix und ihrer Kl{\"{u}}fte beeinflusst werden. Mit gr{\"{o}}{\ss}er werdendem Unterschied zwischen Matrix- und Kluftdurchl{\"{a}}ssigkeit nimmt das Kluftnetzwerk an Bedeutung zu.. Die Str{\"{o}}mungs- bzw. Transportgeschwindigkeit innerhalb des Kluftsystems ist abh{\"{a}}ngig von der Kluftart, der Kluft{\"{o}}ffnung und –orientierung. Einzelkl{\"{u}}fte mit gro{\ss}en {\"{O}}ffnungsweiten k{\"{o}}nnen gegen{\"{u}}ber Bereichen hoher Kluftdichte eine besonders gro{\ss}e Str{\"{o}}mungsgeschwindigkeit aufweisen. Das nat{\"{u}}rliche W{\"{a}}rmefeld f{\"{u}}hrt zu einer Beschleunigung der Grundwasserstr{\"{o}}mung und kann den Transportpfad der Radionuklide stark ver{\"{a}}ndern. Die bisherigen orientierenden Modellierungen der Biosph{\"{a}}re f{\"{u}}hrten unter Verwendung der vorhandenen Daten und Modellannahmen zu einer Strahlenexposition, die in keinem Fall weder den deutschen noch den russischen Grenzwerte erreicht. Die Ergebnisse legen nahe, f{\"{u}}r eine Endlagerung radioaktiven Abfalls im Hartgestein eine m{\"{o}}glichst gro{\ss}e 5 Entfernung zur n{\"{a}}chsten, hydraulisch aktiven Kluft einzuhalten. Dem anf{\"{a}}nglichen diffusiven Transport durch eine wenig gest{\"{o}}rte und daher gering durchl{\"{a}}ssige Gesteinsmatrix kommt im Hinblick auf das Isolationspotenzial der geologischen Barriere eine besonders gro{\ss}e Bedeutung zu, da dieser Gesteinsbereich die Gesamttransportzeit ganz wesentlich bestimmt. Weiterhin sollten in Grundwasserstr{\"{o}}mungsrichtung verlaufende Lagerkl{\"{u}}fte gemieden werden. Deshalb ist die Existenz und der Verlauf von Einzelkl{\"{u}}ften in Endlagern{\"{a}}he zu untersuchen. Aus den Untersuchungen wird ersichtlich, dass es im Hartgestein aufgrund der Wasserwegsamkeiten innerhalb des Kluftnetzwerks schnell zu einem Austrag der Radionuklide in die Biosph{\"{a}}re mit entsprechend hohen Expositionsraten kommen kann. Der technischen Endlagerbarriere kommt daher eine besondere Bedeutung zu. Auf der Grundlage der verf{\"{u}}gbaren Daten wurde mit der geologischen 3-D Modellierung zweier Standorte im Territorium Krasnojarsk begonnen (s. Kap. 5), um eine komplexe Interpretation der Erkundungsergebnisse an den vorausgew{\"{a}}hlten Standorten vorzunehmen. Auf der Grundlage der verf{\"{u}}gbaren geowissenschaftlichen Daten und Informationen wurde begonnen, eine Einsch{\"{a}}tzung der langzeitlichen geologischen Entwicklung des Nishnekansker Granitoidmassives zu erarbeiten (Kap. 6). Dies eine der Voraussetzungen f{\"{u}}r die Bewertung der Eignung dieses Territoriums f{\"{u}}r die Errichtung eines geologischen Endlagers. Obwohl diese Arbeit erst am Anfang steht, konnte ausgehend von den bisher vorliegenden geologischgeophysikalischen Erkundungsergebnissen, vorbehaltlich einer gr{\"{u}}ndlicheren Auseinandersetzung mit dieser Themenstellung, f{\"{u}}r das Gebiet des Nishnekansker Granitoidmassivs eine f{\"{u}}r die HAW-Endlagerung geeignete langzeitliche geologische Entwicklung prognostiziert werden. In Kap. 7 wurden wesentliche Anforderungen an den Standort Nishnekansker Granitoidmassiv zusammengestellt. Die Grundlage hierf{\"{u}}r waren: • Gegen{\"{u}}berstellung der geowissenschaftlichen Anforderungen an einen Endlagerstandort in einer Granitformation mit einer Analyse der gegenw{\"{a}}rtigen geowissenschaftlichen Daten und Informationen zum Nishnekansker Granitoidmassiv • Thermische Berechnungen zum Endlagerkonzept, aus denen Anforderungen an den Standort hinsichtlich der erforderlichen Gr{\"{o}}{\ss}e eines weitestgehend homogenen Gest},

abstract = {Glaciation is considered as one of the main natural processes that can have a significant impact on the long term performance of a deep geological nuclear waste repository (DGR) located in the Northern Hemisphere. The northern part of the American continent has been subjected to a series of strong glaciation and deglaciation events over the past million years. The last glacial cycle in the Northern Hemisphere started approximately 110,000. year ago. During that cycle, southern Ontario was buried under a continental ice sheet, with a maximum thickness of up to 3000. m at about 20,000. years ago. The ice cap retreated approximately 10,000. years ago. However, field data from deep boreholes in sedimentary rocks of southern Ontario show anomalous pore water pressure including underpressure and overpressure zones. In this paper, a large-scale coupled hydro-mechanical (HM) model is developed to investigate the hydro-mechanical (HM) response of the sedimentary rocks of southern Ontario to past glacial cycles. Particular emphasis has been placed on the evolution of pore water pressures and surface displacements. The HM model is verified using analytical solutions. The results of the large-scale HM modeling study shows that the past glaciation, particularly the second cycle (22,000 apb) had significant impact on the pore water pressure gradient and effective stress distribution in the sedimentary rocks of southern Ontario. Furthermore, good agreement between the large scale modeling results and anomalous pressures leads us to the conclusion that these anomalies could be glacially induced. The results of this research can provide information that will contribute to a better understanding of the impact of future glaciations on the long term performance of DRGs in sedimentary rocks. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Geochemical conditions in intracratonic sedimentary basins are currently reducing, even at relatively shallow depths. However, during glaciation-deglaciation events, glacial meltwater production may result in enhanced recharge (Bea et al., 2011; and Bea et al., 2016) potentially having high concentrations of dissolved oxygen (O2). In this study, the reactive transport code Par-MIN3PTHCm was used to perform an informed, illustrative set of simulations assessing the depth of penetration of low salinity, O2-rich, subglacial recharge. Simulation results indicate that the large-scale basin hydrostratigraphy, in combination with the presence of dense brines at depth, results in low groundwater velocities during glacial meltwater infiltration, restricting the vertical ingress of dilute recharge waters. Furthermore, several geochemical attenuation mechanisms exist for O2, which is consumed by reactions with reduced mineral phases and solid organic matter (SOM). The modeling showed that effective oxidative mineral dissolution rates and SOMoxidation rates between 5 × 10-15 and 6 × 10-13 mol dm-3 bulk s-1 were sufficient to restrict the depth of O2 ingress to less than 200m.These effective rates are low and thus conservative, in comparison to rates reported in the literature. Additional simulations with more realistic, yet still conservative, parameters reaffirm the limited ability for O2 to penetrate into sedimentary basin rocks during a glaciation-deglaciation event.},

abstract = {We reconstruct patterns of subglacial processes on a hard bedrock and a soft bed under the southern sector of Scandinavian Ice Sheet (SIS) occurring in the basal till of the Late Saalian Glaciation at the Wapienno, Barcin and M{\l}odocin sites (north-central Poland). Based on detailed sedimentological studies, two phases of SIS transgression were recognised. In the initial phase of the transgression, the SIS advanced onto a frozen substrate (continuous permafrost). The low permeability of the substratum led to a high subglacial water pressure (SWP) and increased basal sliding. The local increase of SWP led to the development of different types of structures and sediments. On a hard bedrock, with low SWP, abrasion predominated and linear structures were developing, while in the case of high SWP, the ice was decoupled from the hard substrate, pressurised liquefied sediment flowed, and structures of the p-form and s-form type developed. On a soft bed, the ice-bed contact was of a mosaic type and the ice movement had an ice-stream character. The ice-stream developed towards the east in the marginal zone of the SIS and used a W-E oriented valley filled by the Wapienno Formation fluvial complex. During a later phase, the ice movement was slower and did not have a stream character. Its direction changed to SE. The deposition of the main part of the diamicton occurred mainly as a result of the lodgement process.},

abstract = {The Gaussian plume model is a standard approach for studying the transport of airborne contaminants due to turbulent diffusion and advection by the wind. This paper reviews the assumptions underlying the model, its derivation from the advection-diffusion equation, and the key properties of the plume solution. The results are then applied to solving an inverse problem in which emission source rates are determined from a given set of groundlevel contaminant measurements. This source identification problem can be formulated as an overdetermined linear system of equations that is most easily solved using the method of least squares. Various generalizations of this problem are discussed, and we illustrate our results with an application to the study of zinc emissions from a smelting operation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract = {In this paper, coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) issues relating to nuclear waste repository design and performance are reviewed. Concise statements, that were developed from DECOVALEX discussions, on the current state-of-knowledge are presented. Section 1 describes the THM background and the interface with performance assessment (PA). The role of THM issues in the overall repository design context is amplified in Section 2, which includes a review of the processes in terms of repository excavation, operation and post-closure stages. It is important to understand the overall context, the detailed THM issues, the associated modelling and how these issues will be resolved in the wider framework. Also, because uncoupled and coupled numerical codes have been used for this subject, there is discussion in Section 3 on the nature of the codes and how the content of the codes can be audited. To what extent does a particular code capture the essence of the problem in hand? Consideration is also given to the associated question of code selection and the future of numerical codes. The state-of-knowledge statements are presented in Section 4 under 11 headings which follow the repository design sequence. The overview conclusion is that "A predictive THM capability is required to support repository design because precedent practice information is insufficient. Many aspects of THM processes and modelling are now well understood and there is a variety of numerical codes available to provide solutions for different host rock and repository conditions. However, modelling all the THM mechanisms in space and time is extremely complex and simplifications will have to be made - if only because it is not possible to obtain all the necessary detailed supporting information. Therefore, an important step is to clarify the THM modelling requirement within the PA context. This will help to indicate the complexity of THM modelling required and hence the models, mechanisms, type of computing, supporting data, laboratory and in situ testing, etc., required. An associated transparent and open audit trail should be developed." We also include comments from reviewers and highlight four outstanding issues which are currently being studied in the DECOVALEX III programme. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The main results of the project are characterised by the developed repository concepts adapted to the geological conditions. The specific quantifications of the integrity criteria and their exemplary application with calculational proofs were used to demonstrate the integrity of the host rocks. The development of site-specific FEP (features, events, and processes) cataloges provided a complete system description for evaluation of the repository evolution. The developed work flow of the demonstration concept illustrated the complete sequence of the safety proof in a transparent way. It shows that various steps have to be performed, possibly iteratively, to provide a successful safety proof. The results form a useful tool in the pending search for a HLW repository site, especially when providing a basis for comparing safety analyses of different sites in Germany.},

abstract = {The PLEIADES software environment is devoted to the thermomechanical simulation of nuclear fuel elements behaviour under irradiation. This platform is co-developed in the framework of a research cooperative program between {\'{E}}lectricit{\'{e}} de France (EDF), AREVA and the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). As many thermomechanical solvers are used within the platform, one of the PLEAIADES's main challenge is to propose a unified software environment for capitalisation of material knowledge coming from research and development programs on various nuclear systems. This paper introduces a tool called mfront which is basically a code generator based on C++ (Stroustrup and Eberhardt, 2004). Domain specific languages are provided which were designed to simplify the implementations of new material properties, mechanical behaviours and simple material models. mfront was recently released under the GPL open-source licence and is available on its web site: http://tfel.sourceforge.net/. The authors hope that it will prove useful for researchers and engineers, in particular in the field of solid mechanics. mfront interfaces generate code specific to each solver and language considered. In this paper, after a general overview of mfront functionalities, a particular focus is made on mechanical behaviours which are by essence more complex and may have significant impact on the numerical performances of mechanical simulations. mfront users can describe all kinds of mechanical phenomena, such as viscoplasticity, plasticity and damage, for various types of mechanical behaviour (small strain or finite strain behaviour, cohesive zone models). Performance benchmarks, performed using the Code-Aster finite element solver, show that the code generated using mfront is in most cases on par or better than the behaviour implementations written in fortran natively available in this solver. The material knowledge management strategy that was set up within the PLEIADES platform is briefly discussed. A material database named sirius proposes a rigorous material verification workflow. We illustrate the use of mfront through two case of studies: a simple FFC single crystal viscoplastic behaviour and the implementation of a recent behaviour for the fuel material which describes various phenomena: fuel cracking, plasticity and viscoplasticity.},

It is shown that when the model output is smooth with regards to the inputs, a spectral convergence of the computed sensitivity indices is achieved. However, even for smooth outputs the method is limited to a moderate number of inputs, say 10-20, as it becomes computationally too demanding to reach the convergence domain. Alternative methods (such as sampling strategies) are then more attractive. The method is also challenged when the output is non-smooth even when the number of inputs is limited. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Within the framework of DECOVALEX 2015, Task A, this work presents the model validation of OpenGeoSys by numerical modelling of coupled hydromechanical (HM) processes in bentonite–sand mixtures. Parameters used in the HM model were determined by modelling the laboratory tests of the sealing experiment (SEALEX). Afterwards these parameters were applied for the modelling of a small-scale mock-up test considering the influence of technological gap and incidental fail of the seal in the sealing system. In order to investigate the availability of employing these HM parameters and numerical models directly to field predictions, the modelling results and measured data of an in situ SEALEX experiment were analysed comparatively. The modelling results reproduced well the main features in HM behaviour of the compacted bentonite–sand mixture, which denotes that the adopted HM models and parameters are adequate for describing the HM processes in the sealing system. It is necessary to take the elastoplastic behaviour and evolution of the permeability of bentonite–sand mixtures into account when using the adopted models to reproduce the HM processes of a sealing system.},

In this regard, the present article reviews the theoretical and numerical framework for the description of geomechanical and biomechanical problems including elastic, elasto-plastic and visco-elastic solid behaviour partly combined with electro-active properties. For this purpose, the Theory of Porous Media is applied for an elegant consideration of the coupling phenomena of porous solids with pore fluids, no matter if the fluids have to be treated as inert fluids or as fluid mixtures. In the sense of a review article, different computational examples are presented to illuminate the possibilities and challenges of porous-media mechanics.},

abstract = {Significant pressure and temperature changes can occur within geothermal reservoirs caused by injection and production of fluid which can affect transport properties of the rocks and therefore alter reservoir performance and sustainability. To understand the coupling between transport properties evolution and state variable changes, a complete description of the mechanical behavior of the reservoir is required which should consider thermo- and poroelastic effects. This study aims to integrate transport properties evolution for coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) process modelling of fluid-bearing reservoirs. This approach is here applied to the geothermal research site of Gro{\ss} Sch{\"{o}}nebeck (40km north of Berlin, Germany) which consists of a doublet system at a target depth of about −4100m in which both injection and production wells have been hydraulically stimulated. A 3D reservoir model including the main geological units, major natural fault zones and hydraulic fractures is integrated in the finite-element method-based simulator OpenGeoSys for modelling coupled THM processes during geothermal activity. One challenge of this study is to integrate both hydro-geological and physical complexity to better describe the dynamic behavior of the geothermal reservoir. From the results of the simulation, thermal breakthrough is observed after 18years of injection and life time of the system has been evaluated as 50years. Furthermore, a 5.5{\%} increase of porosity around the injection well is observed as well as an increase of the anisotropy ratio for permeability (kz/kxy) of about 2{\%}. These transport properties enhancements lead to a decrease of the thermal breakthrough time (around −8{\%}) and life time of the system (−14{\%}) compared to classic thermo-hydro simulations with constant transport properties. The results presented here provide therefore valuable insights for understanding porosity and permeability distributions and evolutions during injection and production of geothermal fluids and related impacts on reservoir performance.},

abstract = {Permafrost, as an important part of the Cryosphere, has been strongly affected by climate warming, and a wide spread of permafrost responses to the warming is currently observed. In particular, at some locations rather slow rates of permafrost degradations are noticed. We related this behavior to the presence of unfrozen water in frozen fine-grained earth material. In this paper, we examine not-very-commonly-discussed heat flux from the ground surface into the permafrost and consequently discuss implications of the presence of unfrozen liquid water on long-term thawing of permafrost. We conducted a series of numerical experiments and demonstrated that the presence of fine-grained material with substantial unfrozen liquid water content at below 0°C temperature can significantly slow down the thawing rate and hence can increase resilience of permafrost to the warming events. This effect is highly nonlinear, and a difference between the rates of thawing in fine- and coarse-grained materials is more drastic for lower values of heat flux incoming into permafrost. For high heat flux, the difference between these rates almost disappears. As near-surface permafrost temperature increases towards 0°C and the changes in the ground temperature become less evident, the future observation networks should try to incorporate measurements of unfrozen liquid water content in the near-surface permafrost and heat flux into permafrost in addition to the existing temperature observations.},

The models are extensions of a recent work and considers pressure dependent behavior for porous SMAs as well as the coupling effects of transformation and plasticity for both dense and porous SMAs. In contrast to dense SMAs, a considerable plastic strain accumulates in porous SMAs even during phase transformation.

Numerical predictions are compared with experimental results and a comprehensive study is performed on the material parameters regarding coupling effects and pressure dependency. Moreover, we implement the model using corotational formulation and perform finite element analysis of a porous SMA spring actuator, and a tube under non-proportional loading to assess the reliability of the proposed model for large rotations and general multiaxial loadings.},

Here, on the basis of a new elastoplasticity model for porous cohesive materials and a large strain hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian numerical method, we accurately reproduced the onset and propagation dynamics of anticracks observed in snow fracture experiments. The key ingredient consists of a modified strain-softening plastic flow rule that captures the complexity of porous materials under mixed-mode loading accounting for the interplay between cohesion loss and volumetric collapse. Our unified model represents a significant step forward as it simulates solid-fluid phase transitions in geomaterials which is of paramount importance to mitigate and forecast gravitational hazards.},

abstract = {The two-phase composite approach of Estrin et al. (1998) describes an evolving dislocation cell structure with dislocation populations for cell walls and the interior. Mckenzie et al. (2007) enhanced the model to capture the effects of hydrostatic pressure and temperature during severe plastic deformation. The main goal of the present study is to extend this microstructural model to non-proportional deformation in order to develop a framework suitable for the simulation of dislocation density evolution upon load path changes. Thereby, the two-phase composite approach is examined carefully. Both physical and numerical drawbacks are revealed and possible solutions are presented. Here, a special aim is to ensure that values of the dislocation densities remain within a physically reasonable range. Moreover, some improvements concerning reliable parameter identification are suggested as well. The material parameters are identified for an aluminum alloy using TEM cell size measurements. The extension to non-proportional deformation aims to predict the experimentally observed dissolution of cells and reduction of total dislocation density shortly after load path change. In order to capture these effects, some tensor-valued state variables are introduced which couple the refined micro model with the macroscopic viscoplasticity framework proposed by Shutov and Krei{\ss}ig (2008a). As a result, a new system of constitutive equations is obtained. In order to demonstrate the framework's capability to respond to load path changes, load cases as typical for Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) are considered. The obtained evolution of dislocation populations differs significantly depending on which ECAP route is applied. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Glaciological observations of under-flooding suggest that fluid-induced hydraulic fracture of an ice sheet from its bed sometimes occurs quickly, possibly driven by turbulently flowing water in a broad sheet flow. Taking the approximation of a fully turbulent flow into an elastic ice medium with small fracture toughness, we derive an approximate expression for the crack-tip speed, opening displacement and pressure profile. We accomplish this by first showing that a Manning-Strickler channel model for resistance to turbulent flow leads to a mathematical structure somewhat similar to that for resistance to laminar flow of a power law viscous fluid. We then adapt the plane-strain asymptotic crack solution of Desroches et al. (1994) and the power law self-similar solution of Adachi and Detournay (2002) for that case to calculate the desired quantities. The speed of crack growth is shown to scale as the overpressure (in excess of ice overburden) to the power 7/6, inversely as ice elastic modulus to the power 2/3, and as the ratio of crack length to wall roughness scale to the power 1/6. We tentatively apply our model by choosing parameter values thought appropriate for a basal crack driven by the rapid drainage of a surface meltwater lake near the margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Making various approximations perhaps relevant to this setting, we estimate fluid inflow rate to the basal fracture and vertical and horizontal surface displacements and find order-of-magnitude agreement with observations by Das et al. (2008) associated with lake drainage. Finally, we discuss how these preliminary estimates could be improved.Copyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {The material point method (MPM) has been increasingly used for the simulation of large-deformation processes in fluid-infiltrated porous materials. For undrained poromechanical problems, however, standard MPMs are numerically unstable because they use low-order interpolation functions that violate the inf–sup stability condition. In this work, we develop stabilized MPM formulations for dynamic and quasi-static poromechanics that permit the use of standard low-order interpolation functions notwithstanding the drainage condition. For the stabilization of both dynamic and quasi-static formulations, we utilize the polynomial pressure projection method whereby a stabilization term is augmented to the balance of mass. The stabilization term can be implemented with both the original and generalized interpolation material point (GIMP) methods, and it is compatible with existing time-integration methods. Here we use fully-implicit methods for both dynamic and quasi-static poromechanical problems, aided by a block-preconditioned Newton–Krylov solver. The stabilized MPMs are verified and investigated through several numerical examples under dynamic and quasi-static conditions. Results show that the proposed MPM formulations allow standard low-order interpolation functions to be used for both the solid displacement and pore pressure fields of poromechanical formulations, from undrained to drained conditions, and from dynamic to quasi-static conditions.},

@article{Nasir2011,
abstract = {Glaciation is considered as one of the main natural processes that can have a significant impact on the long term performance of a deep geological nuclear waste repository (DGR) located in the Northern Hemisphere. The northern part of the American continent has been subjected to a series of strong glaciation and deglaciation events over the past million years. The last glacial cycle in the Northern Hemisphere started approximately 110,000. year ago. During that cycle, southern Ontario was buried under a continental ice sheet, with a maximum thickness of up to 3000. m at about 20,000. years ago. The ice cap retreated approximately 10,000. years ago. However, field data from deep boreholes in sedimentary rocks of southern Ontario show anomalous pore water pressure including underpressure and overpressure zones. In this paper, a large-scale coupled hydro-mechanical (HM) model is developed to investigate the hydro-mechanical (HM) response of the sedimentary rocks of southern Ontario to past glacial cycles. Particular emphasis has been placed on the evolution of pore water pressures and surface displacements. The HM model is verified using analytical solutions. The results of the large-scale HM modeling study shows that the past glaciation, particularly the second cycle (22,000 apb) had significant impact on the pore water pressure gradient and effective stress distribution in the sedimentary rocks of southern Ontario. Furthermore, good agreement between the large scale modeling results and anomalous pressures leads us to the conclusion that these anomalies could be glacially induced. The results of this research can provide information that will contribute to a better understanding of the impact of future glaciations on the long term performance of DRGs in sedimentary rocks. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

To motivate such a model, the infinitesimal-strain assumption is shown to be inadequate for the constitutive description of soft clays. Hence, assuming the multiplicative elasto-plastic decomposition of the deformation gradient, a finite-strain Cam-clay model is presented. In particular, with respect to the original Cam-clay formulation, this model improves the description of the isotropic compression behaviour as well as of the elastic shearing response. The constitutive laws are discussed and their implications are pointed out. The physical meaning of the model parameters is carefully addressed. Finally, the ability to properly match some experimental results available in the literature is assessed. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the theory of second gradient electromagnetostatics as the static version of second gradient electrodynamics. The theory of second gradient electrodynamics is a linear generalization of higher order of classical Maxwell electrodynamics whose Lagrangian is both Lorentz and U(1)-gauge invariant. Second gradient electromagnetostatics is a gradient field theory with up to second-order derivatives of the electromagnetic field strengths in the Lagrangian. Moreover, it possesses a weak nonlocality in space and gives a regularization based on higher-order partial differential equations. From the group theoretical point of view, in second gradient electromagnetostatics the (isotropic) constitutive relations involve an invariant scalar differential operator of fourth order in addition to scalar constitutive parameters. We investigate the classical static problems of an electric point charge, and electric and magnetic dipoles in the framework of second gradient electromagnetostatics, and we show that all the electromagnetic fields (potential, field strength, interaction energy, interaction force) are singularity-free, unlike the corresponding solutions in the classical Maxwell electromagnetism and in the Bopp-Podolsky theory. The theory of second gradient electromagnetostatics delivers a singularity-free electromagnetic field theory with weak spatial nonlocality.},

abstract = {The hydrodynamic consequences of a glaciation/deglaciation cycle within an intercratonic sedimentary basin on subsurface transport processes is assessed using numerical models. In our analysis we consider the effects of mechanical ice sheet loading, permafrost formation, variable density fluids, and lithospheric flexure on solute/isotope transport, groundwater residence times, and transient hydraulic head distributions. The simulations are intended to apply, in a generic sense, to intercratonic sedimentary basins that would have been near the southern limit of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the last glacial maximum (∼20 ka B.P.), such as the Williston, Michigan, and Illinois basins. We show that in such basins fluid flow and recharge rates are strongly elevated during glaciation as compared to nonglacial periods. Furthermore, our results illustrate that steady state hydrodynamic conditions in these basins are probably never reached during a 32.5 ka cycle of advance and retreat of a wet-based ice sheet. Present-day hydrogeological conditions across formerly glaciated areas are likely to still reflect the impact of the last glaciation and associated processes that ended locally more than 10 ka B.P. Our results reveal characteristic spatial patterns of underpressure and overpressure that occur in aquitards and aquifers, respectively, as a result of recent glaciation. The calculated emplacement of low salinity, isotopically light glacial meltwater along basin margins is roughly consistent with observations from formerly glaciated basins in North America. The modeling presented in this study will help to improve the management of groundwater resources in formerly glaciated basins as well as to evaluate the viability on geological timescales of nuclear waste repositories located at high latitudes.

On the other hand, we integrate material from the CLEAN project into this framework to demonstrate its applicability (K{\"{u}}hn et al. in Environ Earth Sci, this issue 2011). Benchmarks are an important instrument to gain a better understanding of interacting physico-chemical processes and they are a necessary tool to verify the algorithms and the software dedicated to simulate the separated and differently coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical/chemical processes during injecting and storing CO 2 in the subsurface. In general we distinguish between process- and site-related test cases. Process-related benchmarks deal with the required complexity of process coupling as well as equations of state for fluids and constitutive laws for geologic formations. Site-specific benchmarks represent different geological settings for potential CO 2 reservoirs, e. g., depleted gas and oil reservoirs as well as deep saline aquifers. The data basis for benchmarking mainly comes from experimental work in the CLEAN project as well as from literature. The benchmarking systematic is aimed at serving as basis for process studies, experimental design as well as for code inter-comparison purposes not only for numerical tools having used by the CLEAN partners but also for upcoming international benchmarking initiatives as well. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

The formulation considers each thermal, hydraulic and mechanical process, and their various interactions, through fundamental physical laws and models. By employing a combination of ice pressure, liquid pressure and total stress as state variables, a new mechanical model has been developed that encompasses frozen and unfrozen behaviour within a unified effective-stress-based framework. Important frozen soil features such as temperature and porosity dependence of shear strength are captured inherently by the model. Potential applications to geotechnics include analysis of frost heave, foundation stability or mass movements in cold regions. The model's performance is demonstrated with reference to the in situ pipeline frost heave tests conducted by Slusarchuk et al. Detailed consideration is given to FE mesh design, the influence of hydraulic parameters, and the treatment of air/ground interface boundary conditions. The THM simulation is shown to reproduce, with fair accuracy, the observed pipeline heave and the porosity growth driven by water migration.},

The plasticity model is coupled with {\'{a}} nonlinear hyperelastic model to ensure that the elastic component of the combined model is energy-conserving. A key feature of the integration algorithm for the combined model is a return mapping in strain space, which allows fully implicit integration and consistent linearization of the constitutive equations. For this class of bounding surface models the consistency condition on the bounding surface is shown to be mathematically equivalent to the consistency condition on the loading surface, thus allowing practically all attributes of the standard return mapping algorithm of classical plasticity theory to be carried over to the bounding surface theory with little modification. As a specific example, the infinitesimal version of modified Cam-Clay theory is used to represent the bounding surface model, and an exponential function is used to interpolate the plastic modulus on the loading surface. Isoerror maps are generated describing the accuracy of the integration algorithm on the stress-point level. Finally, a boundary-value problem involving a strip footing on lightly overconsolidated clay is analyzed to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm in a finite element setting. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {In the context of geotechnical and geological barriers, a thorough analysis of uncertainty and sensitivity is a crucial aspect of any physics-based performance assessment. While experimental data are scarce in actual waste repositories, large-scale experiments in underground research laboratories (URLs) provide such data that can be used to not only qualify THMC process models but also uncertainty assessment methodologies. In this paper, we adopt a Design of Experiments (DoE)-based history matching workflow – an approach popular in the oil and gas industry – and scrutinize its applicability for multiphysical analyses of nuclear waste disposal-related processes using synthetic experimental data. Based on an analytical solution of a coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) problem of a heat source embedded in a fluid-saturated porous medium mimicking a disposal cell in an argillaceous host formation, we discuss the adaptability of the workflow as a way to address parameter and model uncertainties for barrier integrity assessment. We thereby put particular focus on the relative importance of providing defined input parameter distributions for quantities generally afflicted with epistemic uncertainty and the constraints imposed by experimental (URL) or monitoring (repository) data. We found that once constraining data is available, the particular a priori distribution plays only a minor role for the outcome, such that we can conclude that the often unknown distributions can be substituted by uniform priors under such conditions. However, detailed knowledge of parameter distributions can increase the efficiency of the workflow significantly. We conclude that the presented workflow is particularly suitable for performing uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis for geotechnical applications where monitoring or other experimental data are available, as it allows us to deal with models of great complexity, epistemic uncertainty and it incorporates canonically to use of measured data in order to reduce uncertainty.},

abstract = {The critical state soil mechanics described in this paper is based on a soil model called Cam clay model developed by the Cambridge soil mechanics group in the early sixties, and the modifications made to the model thereafter. In this model, the soil structure is assumed to behave mechanically as an elasto-plastic isotropic continuous medium. Further, the section of the yield surface for soils is assumed to be of the extended von Mises type. In the Cam clay model, it is suggested that the yield surfaces are close to being a family of bullet shapes. The sharp end of the bullet corresponds to isotropic virgin consolidation. The model has been developed using carefully established experimental data available from standard triaxial tests and then extended to the generalized stress system.},

@article{Muller2017,
abstract = {Opalinus Clay is currently being assessed as the host rock for a deep geological repository for high-level and low- and intermediate-level radioactive wastes in Switzerland. Within this framework, the ‘Full-Scale Emplacement' (FE) experiment was initiated at the Mont Terri rock laboratory close to the small town of St-Ursanne in Switzerland. The FE experiment simulates, as realistically as possible, the construction, waste emplacement, backfilling and early post-closure evolution of a spent fuel/vitrified high-level waste disposal tunnel according to the Swiss repository concept. The main aim of this multiple heater test is the investigation of repository-induced thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) coupled effects on the host rock at this scale and the validation of existing coupled THM models. For this, several hundred sensors were installed in the rock, the tunnel lining, the bentonite buffer, the heaters and the plug. This paper is structured according to the implementation timeline of the FE experiment. It documents relevant details about the instrumentation, the tunnel construction, the production of the bentonite blocks and the highly compacted ‘granulated bentonite mixture' (GBM), the development and construction of the prototype ‘backfilling machine' (BFM) and its testing for horizontal GBM emplacement. Finally, the plug construction and the start of all 3 heaters (with a thermal output of 1350 Watt each) in February 2015 are briefly described. In this paper, measurement results representative of the different experimental steps are also presented. Tunnel construction aspects are discussed on the basis of tunnel wall displacements, permeability testing and relative humidity measurements around the tunnel. GBM densities achieved with the BFM in the different off-site mock-up tests and, finally, in the FE tunnel are presented. Finally, in situ thermal conductivity and temperature measurements recorded during the first heating months are presented.},

abstract = {The material point method (MPM) has been increasingly used for the simulation of large-deformation processes in fluid-infiltrated porous materials. For undrained poromechanical problems, however, standard MPMs are numerically unstable because they use low-order interpolation functions that violate the inf–sup stability condition. In this work, we develop stabilized MPM formulations for dynamic and quasi-static poromechanics that permit the use of standard low-order interpolation functions notwithstanding the drainage condition. For the stabilization of both dynamic and quasi-static formulations, we utilize the polynomial pressure projection method whereby a stabilization term is augmented to the balance of mass. The stabilization term can be implemented with both the original and generalized interpolation material point (GIMP) methods, and it is compatible with existing time-integration methods. Here we use fully-implicit methods for both dynamic and quasi-static poromechanical problems, aided by a block-preconditioned Newton–Krylov solver. The stabilized MPMs are verified and investigated through several numerical examples under dynamic and quasi-static conditions. Results show that the proposed MPM formulations allow standard low-order interpolation functions to be used for both the solid displacement and pore pressure fields of poromechanical formulations, from undrained to drained conditions, and from dynamic to quasi-static conditions.},

abstract = {An improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) was proposed and the intelligent algorithms such as IPSO, genetic algorithm (GA), and simulated annealing algorithm (SA) were introduced to determine parameters of Van Genuchten (VG) model for soil water retention curve (SWRC) of four typical agricultural soil textures (clay, clay loam, silt loam and sand loam) in China. For comparison, the SWRC in term of VG model was also fitted by a computer program RETC and pedotransfer function Rosetta, respectively. For four soil textures, the value of determination coefficient (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) in the estimation of VG equation parameters by IPSO are the highest and lowest in the above three intelligent algorithms, respectively. The simulated values of water content by IPSO are much closed to the measured values (R2 = 0.990). It was found that the Rosetta is unable to estimate the SWRC adequately and the highest RMSE value is up to 1.096E -01cm3cm-3. The predicted values of moisture content by Rosetta are far away from the measured values (R2 = 0.585). The RETC provided good simulation results of water content (R2 = 0.974). However, the soil residual water content ($\theta$r), of VG equation can not be obtained. It was concluded that the IPSO presented here is more reasonable and reliable to estimate the SWRC in term of VG model than the method of GA, SA, RETC and Rosetta. {\textcopyright} 2013 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.},

This material variety is matched by the range of relevant stresses and strain rates, from laminar to turbulent flows and steady to intermittent forcing, leading to anything from rapid and catastrophic landslides to the slow relaxation of soil and rocks over geologic timescales. From a physics point of view, virtually all Earth and planetary landscapes are composed of soft matter, in the sense that they are both deformable and sensitive to collective effects. Geophysical materials, however, often involve compositions and flow geometries that have not yet been examined in physics. In this Review, we explore how a soft-matter physics perspective has helped to illuminate, and even predict, the rich dynamics of earth materials and their associated landscapes. We also highlight phenomena of geophysical flows that challenge, and will hopefully inspire, work on more fundamental aspects of soft matter.},

The framework is based on the modelling and parametrisation of the material's microstructure via laminates together with the respective volume fractions. These volume fractions are treated as internal-state variables and are subject to several inequality constraints which can be treated in terms of Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. The Fischer–Burmeister NCP function provides a sophisticated scheme to incorporate Karush–Kuhn–Tucker-type conditions into calculations of internal-state variables. However, these functions are prone to numerical instabilities in their original form. Therefore, some enhanced formulations of the Fischer–Burmeister ansatz are discussed and compared to each other in this contribution.},

abstract = {The mechanical behaviour of frozen ground and permafrost is changing under the increasing variation of environmental and anthropogenic boundary conditions. This phenomenon affects many civil structures and infrastructures built in Polar and Alpine areas. Mathematical formulations able to capture the mechanical behaviour of frozen ground and permafrost with adherence to reality and a limited employment of technical resources and time appear crucial for the engineering design and retrofit of these structures. To address this challenge, this study presents a relatively simple elasto-plastic constitutive model for capturing the non-linear mechanical behaviour of frozen silt. The model is based on associated flow rules. It employs an elliptical yield surface and a parabolic yield surface for describing the volumetric mechanisms that characterise the modelled material, together with a parabolic yield surface for describing the deviatoric mechanism. Comparisons with experimental triaxial test results available in the literature highlight the suitability of the model to capture the non-linear mechanical response of frozen silt subjected to both low and high confining pressures. This result, together with the doable implicit consideration in the model of the effects induced by environmental boundary conditions such as temperature on the mechanical behaviour of the material, makes this tool attractive for simplified yet thorough analyses of frozen ground and permafrost-related problems.},

The basic concept is to provide a flexible numerical framework (using primarily the Finite Element Method (FEM)) for solving multifield problems in porous and fractured media for applications in geoscience and hydrology. To this purpose OGS is based on an object-oriented FEM concept including a broad spectrum of interfaces for pre- and postprocessing. The OGS idea has been in development since the mid-eighties. We provide a short historical note about the continuous process of concept and software development having evolved through Fortran, C, and C++ implementations. The idea behind OGS is to provide an open platform to the community, outfitted with professional software-engineering tools such as platform-independent compiling and automated benchmarking. A comprehensive benchmarking book has been prepared for publication. Benchmarking has been proven to be a valuable tool for cooperation between different developer teams, for example, for code comparison and validation purposes (DEVOVALEX and CO 2 BENCH projects). On one hand, object-orientation (OO) provides a suitable framework for distributed code development; however, the parallelization of OO codes still lacks efficiency.
